            <part name="overview">
               <p>Privileged accounts are considered to be those which can alter or circumvent a system’s controls. This can also apply to users who have only limited privileges, such as software developers, but can still bypass controls. A privileged account often has the ability to modify system configurations, account privileges, event logs and security configurations for applications.</p>
               <p>Privileged users, and in some cases privileged service accounts, are often targeted by an adversary as they can potentially give full access to systems. As such, ensuring that privileged accounts do not have the ability to access the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised.</p>
               <p>Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that privileged access event logs and privileged account and group change event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.</p>

               <p>Application control can be an effective way to not only prevent malicious code from executing on workstations and servers, but also to ensure only approved applications can execute. When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm), HTML applications (e.g. .hta), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.</p>
               <p>In implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by an adversary.</p>
               <p>Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that application control event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.</p>

               <p>PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft and, due to its ubiquity and ease with which it can be used to fully control operating systems, is an important part of system administrator toolkits. However, PowerShell can also be a dangerous exploitation tool in the hands of an adversary.</p>
               <p>In order to prevent attacks leveraging security vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 should be disabled or removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between security and functionality.</p>
               <p>Finally, logging and transcription functionality available in PowerShell can provide invaluable information for incident responders. As such, it is important that PowerShell event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>When applications are deployed in their default state it can lead to an insecure operating environment that may allow an adversary to gain an initial foothold on networks. This can be especially risky for office productivity suites, web browsers, email clients, PDF software and security products as such applications are routinely targeted for exploitation. Many configuration settings exist within such applications to allow them to be configured in a secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, the ACSC and vendors often produce guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of such applications. Note, however, in situations where ACSC and vendor guidance conflicts, preference should be given to implementing ACSC hardening guidance.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code, known as a macro, written in the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.</p>
               <p>Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that Microsoft Office macro event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>Multi-factor authentication uses two or more authentication factors. This may include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>something a user knows, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)</li>
                  <li>something a user has, such as a security key, smart card, smartphone or physical one-time password token</li>
                  <li>something a user is, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Note, however, that if a memorised secret is written down, or stored in a document on a system, this becomes something that a user has rather than something a user knows.</p>
               <p>Privileged users, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing an adversary’s ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.</p>
               <p>When implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something a user has should be used as part of multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of verifier impersonation resistant authentication factors are recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.</p>
               <p>Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that multi-factor authentication event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.</p>

               <p>To provide additional security and credential management functionality for service accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts to Microsoft Windows Server. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service Accounts do not require manual credential management by system administrators, as the operating system automatically manages the credentials. This ensures that service account credentials are not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular basis.</p>

               <p>When local administrator accounts use common usernames and credentials, it can allow an adversary that compromises credentials on one workstation or server to easily compromise other workstations and servers. As such, it is critical that credentials for local administrator accounts and service accounts are unique, unpredictable and managed.</p>
               <p>Storing physical credentials with a system, such as security keys, smart cards, one-time password tokens and written down memorised secrets, increases the likelihood of an adversary gaining access to the system. For example, when passphrases are written down and stuck to a computer monitor, smart cards are left on desks or security keys are left in laptop bags. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.</p>
               <p>If storing credentials on a system, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched. In addition, Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials.</p>
               <p>When using Microsoft Windows systems, cached credentials are stored in the Security Accounts Manager database and can allow a user to logon to a workstation they have previously logged onto even if the domain is not available. Whilst this functionality may be desirable from an availability perspective, this functionality can be abused by an adversary who can retrieve these cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.</p>

            <h1>System administration of cloud services</h1>
            <p>System administration of cloud services brings unique challenges when compared to system administration of on-premises assets. Notably, responsibility for system administration of cloud services is often shared between service providers and their customers. As the system administration processes and procedures implemented by service providers are often opaque to their customers, customers should consider a service provider’s control plane to operate within a different security domain.</p>

               <p>One of the greatest threats to the security of networks is the compromise of privileged accounts. Providing a separate privileged operating environment for system administrators, in addition to their unprivileged operating environment, makes it much harder for administrative activities and privileged accounts to be compromised by an adversary.</p>
               <p>Using different physical workstations is the most secure approach to separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments for system administrators. However, a virtualisation-based solution may be sufficient for separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments. In such cases, privileged operating environments should not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments.</p>

               <p>The security of administrative activities can be improved by segregating administrative infrastructure from the wider network. In doing so, the use of a jump server (also known as a jump host or jump box) can be an effective way of simplifying and securing administrative activities. Specifically, a jump server can provide filtering of network management traffic while also acting as a focal point to perform multi-factor authentication; store and manage administrative tools; and perform logging, monitoring and alerting activities. Finally, using separate jump servers for the administration of critical servers, high-value servers and regular servers can further assist in protecting these assets.</p>

               <p>If no patches or updates are available for security vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to security vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.</p>
               <p>If a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, the ACSC will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, the ACSC will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied.</p>

               <p>To ensure that patches or updates have been applied to applications, operating systems, drivers and firmware, it is essential that an organisation scan for missing patches or updates on a regular basis using a vulnerability scanner, preferably in an automated manner. Ideally, vulnerability scanning should take place at half the frequency in which patches or updates need to be applied. For example, if patches or updates are applied fortnightly then vulnerability scanning should be undertaken weekly.</p>

               <p>When applications, operating systems, network devices and other ICT equipment reach their cessation date for support, an organisation will find it increasingly difficult to protect them against security vulnerabilities as patches, updates and other forms of support will no longer be made available by vendors. As such, unsupported applications, operating systems, network devices and other ICT equipment should be removed or replaced. In planning for such activities, it is important to note that while vendors generally advise the cessation date for support of operating systems well in advance, some applications, network devices and other ICT equipment may cease to receive support immediately after newer versions are released.</p>
