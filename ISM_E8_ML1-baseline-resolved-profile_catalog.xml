            <h1>Security clearances</h1>
            <p>Where these guidelines refer to security clearances, it applies to Australian security clearances or security clearances from a foreign government which are formally recognised by Australia.</p>
            <h1>Further information</h1>
            <p>Further information on access to government resources, including required security clearances, can be found in the Department of Home Affairs’ <a href="#92679127-f61d-486a-a93e-df2a26dfb07a">Protective Security Policy Framework</a>.</p>
            <p>Further information on access to highly sensitive government resources, including required briefings, can be found in the Government Security Committee’s Australian Government Security Caveat Guidelines. This publication is available from the Protective Security Policy GovTEAMS community or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by email.</p>
            <p>Further information on restricting the use of privileged user accounts can be found in ASD’s <a href="#3ccea9a8-a728-4f5b-a0a8-43f2f206f76b">Restricting administrative privileges</a> publication.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>Privileged user accounts are considered those that can alter or circumvent system controls. This also applies to user accounts that may only have limited privileges but still have the ability to bypass some system controls.</p>
               <p>Privileged user accounts are often targeted by malicious actors as they can potentially give full access to systems and their resources. As such, ensuring that privileged user accounts are prevented from accessing the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised. However, if privileged user accounts are explicitly authorised to access online services, they should be strictly limited to only what is required for users and services to undertake their duties.</p>
               <p>Finally, centrally logging and analysing privileged access events, as well as privileged user account and security group management events, can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems and their resources, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents.</p>

               <p>When operating systems are deployed in their default state, or with an unapproved configuration, it can lead to an insecure operating environment that may allow malicious actors to gain an initial foothold on networks. Many settings exist within operating systems to allow them to be configured in an approved secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and vendors often produce hardening guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of operating systems. Note, however, in situations where ASD and vendor hardening guidance conflicts, precedence should be given to implementing the most restrictive guidance.</p>

               <p>Application control can be an effective way to not only prevent malicious code from executing on workstations and servers, but also to ensure only approved applications can execute. When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm files), HTML applications (e.g. .hta files), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl files) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.</p>
               <p>In implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by malicious actors.</p>
               <p>Finally, centrally logging and analysing application control events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents.</p>

               <p>Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code, known as a macro, written in the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, malicious actors can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>Multi-factor authentication uses two or more different authentication factors. This may include:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>something users know, such as a password</li>
                  <li>something users have, such as a security key, smart card, passkey, smartphone or one-time password token</li>
                  <li>something users are, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Users of online services, privileged users of systems and users with access to data repositories are more likely to be targeted by malicious actors due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these user accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing malicious actors’ ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.</p>
               <p>When implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something users have should be used with something users know. Alternatively, something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (often known as passwordless multi-factor authentication) can be used. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication is recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.</p>
               <p>Finally, centrally logging and analysing multi-factor authentication events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents.</p>

            <h1>System administration of cloud services</h1>
            <p>System administration of cloud services brings unique challenges when compared to system administration of on-premises assets. Notably, responsibility for system administration of cloud services is often shared between service providers and their customers. As the system administration processes and procedures implemented by service providers are often opaque to their customers, customers should consider a service provider’s control plane to operate within a different security domain.</p>

            <part name="overview">
               <p>One of the greatest threats to the security of networks is the compromise of privileged user accounts. Providing a separate privileged operating environment for system administrators, in addition to their unprivileged operating environment, makes it much harder for administrative activities and privileged user accounts to be compromised by malicious actors.</p>
               <p>Using different physical workstations, with one being a dedicated Secure Admin Workstation, is the most secure approach to separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments for system administrators. However, a trusted and hardened virtualisation-based solution may be sufficient for separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments on the same Secure Admin Workstation. In such cases, privileged operating environments should not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments.</p>

               <p>To ensure that patches or updates are being applied to applications, operating systems, drivers and firmware, it is essential that an organisation regularly identifies all assets within their environment using an automated method of asset discovery, such as an asset discovery tool or a vulnerability scanner with equivalent functionality. Following asset discovery, identified assets can be scanned for missing patches or updates using a vulnerability scanner with an up-to-date vulnerability database. Ideally, vulnerability scanning should be conducted in an automated manner and take place at twice the frequency in which patches or updates need to be applied. For example, if patches or updates are to be applied within two weeks of release then vulnerability scanning should be undertaken at least weekly.</p>

               <p>When patches or updates are released by vendors for vulnerabilities, an organisation should apply them in a timeframe commensurate with the likelihood of attempted exploitation by malicious actors. For example, by prioritising patches or updates for vulnerabilities in online services as well as operating systems of internet-facing servers and internet-facing network devices. This is especially important when vulnerabilities are assessed as critical by vendors or working exploits exist.</p>
               <p>If no patches or updates are available for vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trustworthy authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.</p>
               <p>If a patch or update is released for high assurance IT equipment, ASD will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, ASD will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied.</p>

               <p>When applications, operating systems, network devices and networked IT equipment reach their cessation date for support, and become legacy IT, an organisation will find it increasingly difficult to protect them against vulnerabilities as patches, updates and other forms of support will no longer be made available by vendors. As such, unsupported applications, operating systems, network devices and networked IT equipment should be removed or replaced.</p>
               <p>In planning for cessation of support, it is important to note that while vendors generally advise the cessation date for support of operating systems well in advance, some applications, network devices and networked IT equipment may cease to receive support immediately after newer versions are released.</p>
               <p>Finally, when the immediate removal or replacement of unsupported applications, operating systems, network devices or networked IT equipment is not possible, compensating controls should be implemented until such time that they can be removed or replaced.</p>

               <p>To mitigate the security risk of losing system availability or data as part of a ransomware attack, or other form of destructive attack, backups of data, applications and settings should be performed and retained in accordance with an organisation’s business criticality and business continuity requirements. In doing so, backups of all data, applications and settings should be synchronised to enable restoration to a common point in time. Furthermore, it is essential that all backups are retained in a secure and resilient manner. This will ensure that should a system fall victim to a ransomware attack, or other form of destructive attack, data will not be lost and, if necessary, systems can be quickly restored.</p>
