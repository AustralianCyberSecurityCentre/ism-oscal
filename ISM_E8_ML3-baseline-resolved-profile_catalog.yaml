          # Cyber security events

          A cyber security event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be relevant to security.

          # Cyber security incidents

          A cyber security incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events, that has either compromised business operations or has a significant probability of compromising business operations.

          # Cyber resilience

          Cyber resilience is the ability to adapt to disruptions caused by cyber security incidents while maintaining continuous business operations. This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.

          # Detecting cyber security incidents

          One of the core elements of detecting and investigating cyber security incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources, such as event logs. The following event logs can be used by an organisation to assist with detecting and investigating cyber security incidents:

          - **Cross Domain Solutions:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Databases:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Domain Name System services:** May assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domain names or Internet Protocol addresses indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Email servers:** May assist in identifying users targeted with phishing emails thereby helping to identify the initial vector of a compromise.
          - **Gateways:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Multifunction devices: May assist in**identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating a cyber security incident or malicious insider activity.
          - **Operating systems:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Remote access services:** May assist in identifying unusual locations of access or times of access indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Security services:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Server applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **System access:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **User applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Web applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          - **Web proxies:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.

            The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) uses the cyber security incident reports it receives as the basis for providing assistance to organisations. Cyber security incident reports are also used by ASD to identify trends and maintain an accurate threat environment picture. ASD utilises this understanding to assist in the development of new and updated cyber security advice, capabilities, and techniques to better prevent and respond to evolving cyber threats. An organisation is recommended to internally coordinate their reporting of cyber security incidents to ASD.

            The types of cyber security incidents that should be reported to ASD include:

            - suspicious activities, such as privileged account lockouts and unusual remote access activities
            - compromise of sensitive or classified data
            - unauthorised access or attempts to access a system
            - emails with suspicious attachments or links
            - denial-of-service attacks
            - ransomware attacks.

            Privileged accounts are considered to be those which can alter or circumvent a system’s controls. This can also apply to users who have only limited privileges, such as software developers, but can still bypass controls. A privileged account often has the ability to modify system configurations, account privileges, event logs and security configurations for applications.

            Privileged users, and in some cases privileged service accounts, are often targeted by malicious actors as they can potentially give full access to systems. As such, ensuring that privileged accounts do not have the ability to access the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised.

            Finally, privileged access event logs, privileged account management event logs and privileged group management logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, privileged access event logs, privileged account management event logs and privileged group management logs should be captured and stored centrally.

            Application control can be an effective way to not only prevent malicious code from executing on workstations and servers, but also to ensure only approved applications can execute. When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm files), HTML applications (e.g. .hta files), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl files) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.

            In implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by malicious actors.

            Finally, application control event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, application control event logs should be captured and stored centrally.

            PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft and, due to its ubiquity and ease with which it can be used to fully control operating systems, is an important part of system administrator toolkits. However, PowerShell can also be a dangerous exploitation tool in the hands of malicious actors.

            In order to prevent attacks leveraging vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 should be disabled or removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between security and functionality.

            Finally, PowerShell event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, PowerShell event logs should be captured and stored centrally.

          prose: "When user applications are deployed in their default state it can lead to an insecure operating environment that may allow malicious actors to gain an initial foothold on networks. This can be especially risky for office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products as such applications are routinely targeted for exploitation. Many configuration settings exist within such applications to allow them to be configured in a secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, ASD and vendors often produce hardening guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of these applications. Note, however, in situations where ASD and vendor hardening guidance conflicts, preference should generally be given to implementing ASD hardening guidance."

            Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code, known as a macro, written in the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, malicious actors can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.

            Finally, Microsoft Office macro event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, Microsoft Office macro event logs should be captured and stored centrally.

            Multi-factor authentication uses two or more different authentication factors. This may include:

            - something users know, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)
            - something users have, such as a security key, smart card, smartphone or one-time password token
            - something users are, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.

            Users of online services, privileged users of systems and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by malicious actors due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing malicious actors’ ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.

            When implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something users have should be used with something users know. Alternatively, something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (often known as passwordless multi-factor authentication) can be used. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication is recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.

            Finally, multi-factor authentication event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, multi-factor authentication event logs should be captured and stored centrally.

            When break glass accounts, local administrator accounts and service accounts use common usernames or weak credentials, it may allow malicious actors that compromises credentials on one workstation or server to easily compromise other workstations and servers. As such, it is critical that credentials for break glass accounts, local administrator accounts and service accounts are long, unique, unpredictable and managed.

            To provide additional security and credential management functionality for service accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts to Microsoft Windows Server. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service Accounts do not require manual credential management by system administrators, as the operating system automatically ensures that they are long, unique, unpredictable and managed. This ensures that service account credentials are secure, not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular basis. However, in cases where the use of group Managed Service Accounts is not possible, credentials for service accounts should still be unique and unpredictable with a minimum length of 30 characters.

            Written down credentials (e.g. memorised secrets), and dedicated devices that store or generate credentials (e.g. security keys, smart cards and one-time password tokens), when kept together with systems they are used to authenticate to can increase the likelihood of malicious actors gaining unauthorised access to systems. For example, when smart cards are left on desks, one-time password tokens are left in laptop computer bags, security keys are left connected to computers or passphrases are written down and stuck to computer monitors. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.

            When using Microsoft Windows systems, Protective Process Light for the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard, all preferably with a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) lock, can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials. In addition, malicious actors that have access to systems may attempt to steal cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.

            If storing credentials on systems, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched. Coupled with this, an organisation should regularly scan their systems to detect and remediate any credentials that are being stored in an unprotected manner, such as in the clear in documents, on network file shares or in other data repositories.

          # System administration of cloud services

          System administration of cloud services brings unique challenges when compared to system administration of on-premises assets. Notably, responsibility for system administration of cloud services is often shared between service providers and their customers. As the system administration processes and procedures implemented by service providers are often opaque to their customers, customers should consider a service provider’s control plane to operate within a different security domain.

            One of the greatest threats to the security of networks is the compromise of privileged accounts. Providing a separate privileged operating environment for system administrators, in addition to their unprivileged operating environment, makes it much harder for administrative activities and privileged accounts to be compromised by malicious actors.

            Using different physical workstations is the most secure approach to separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments for system administrators. However, a virtualisation-based solution may be sufficient for separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments. In such cases, privileged operating environments should not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments.

In doing so, the use of a jump server (also known as a jump host or jump box) can be an effective way of simplifying and securing administrative activities. Specifically, a jump server can provide filtering of network management traffic while also acting as a focal point to perform multi-factor authentication; store and manage administrative tools; and perform logging, monitoring and alerting activities. Finally, using separate jump servers for the administration of critical servers, high-value servers and regular servers can further assist in protecting these assets."

Following asset discovery, identified assets can be scanned for missing patches or updates using a vulnerability scanner with an up-to-date vulnerability database. Ideally, vulnerability scanning should be conducted in an automated manner and take place at half the frequency in which patches or updates need to be applied. For example, if patches or updates are to be applied within two weeks of release then vulnerability scanning should be undertaken at least weekly."

            When patches or updates are released by vendors for vulnerabilities, an organisation should apply them in a timeframe commensurate with the likelihood of attempted exploitation by malicious actors. For example, by prioritising patches or updates for vulnerabilities in online services as well as operating systems of internet-facing servers and internet-facing network devices. This is especially important when vulnerabilities are assessed as critical by vendors or working exploits exist.

            If no patches or updates are available for vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.

            If a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, ASD will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, ASD will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied.

            When applications, operating systems, network devices and other ICT equipment reach their cessation date for support, an organisation will find it increasingly difficult to protect them against vulnerabilities as patches, updates and other forms of support will no longer be made available by vendors. As such, unsupported applications, operating systems, network devices and other ICT equipment should be removed or replaced.

            In planning for cessation of support, it is important to note that while vendors generally advise the cessation date for support of operating systems well in advance, some applications, network devices and other ICT equipment may cease to receive support immediately after newer versions are released.

            Finally, when the immediate removal or replacement of unsupported applications, operating systems, network devices or other ICT equipment is not possible, compensating controls should be implemented until such time that they can be removed or replaced.
