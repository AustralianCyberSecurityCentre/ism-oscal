However, where appropriate and practical to do so, responsibility for operational technology cybersecurity may be delegated by the CISO.\n\nWithin this section, the breadth of responsibilities for information technology and operational technology are collectively referenced under the banner of cybersecurity.\n\n# Required skills and experience\n\nThe role of the CISO requires a combination of technical and soft skills, such as business acumen, leadership, communications and relationship building. Additionally, a CISO should adopt a continuous approach to learning and up-skilling in order to maintain pace with the cyberthreat landscape and new technologies. It is expected that a CISO show innovation and imagination in conceiving and delivering cybersecurity strategies for their organisation.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on responding to cybersecurity incidents can be found in the managing cybersecurity incidents section of the [Guidelines for cybersecurity incidents](#fe0138db-e83b-4a23-85d3-d84e1c22816f).\n\nFurther information on the development of a cybersecurity strategy can be found in the development and maintenance of cybersecurity documentation section of the [Guidelines for cybersecurity documentation](#578d0434-6b3f-46f3-aad8-c7ac75c2ebcc).\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on the procurement of outsourced services can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on cybersecurity awareness training programs can be found in the cybersecurity awareness training section of the [Guidelines for personnel security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2)."

          "prose" : "# Cybersecurity events\n\nA cybersecurity event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be relevant to security.\n\n# Cybersecurity incidents\n\nA cybersecurity incident is an unwanted or unexpected cybersecurity event, or a series of such events, that either has compromised business operations or has a significant probability of compromising business operations.\n\n# Cyber resilience\n\nCyber resilience is the ability to adapt to disruptions caused by cybersecurity incidents while maintaining continuous business operations. This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cybersecurity incidents.\n\n# Detecting cybersecurity incidents\n\nOne of the core elements of detecting and investigating cybersecurity incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources, such as event logs. The following event logs can be used by an organisation to assist with detecting and investigating cybersecurity incidents:\n\n- **Cross Domain Solutions:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Databases:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Domain Name System services:** May assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domain names or Internet Protocol addresses indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Email servers:** May assist in identifying users targeted with phishing emails thereby helping to identify the initial vector of a compromise.\n- **Gateways:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Multifunction devices:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating a cybersecurity incident.\n- **Operating systems:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Remote access services:** May assist in identifying unusual locations of access or times of access indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Security products:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Server applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **System access:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **User applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Web applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Web proxies:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther

Specifically, using an alternative system to plan and coordinate intrusion remediation activities will prevent alerting malicious actors if they have already compromised email, messaging or collaboration services. In addition, conducting intrusion remediation activities in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage will prevent forewarning malicious actors, thereby depriving them of sufficient time to establish alternative access points or persistence methods on the system.\n\nFollowing intrusion remediation activities, an organisation should determine whether malicious actors have been successfully removed from the system, including whether or not they have since reacquired access. This can be achieved, in part, by capturing and analysing network traffic for at least seven days following remediation activities."

            "prose" : "Cyber supply chain risk management activities should be conducted during the earliest possible stage of procurement of applications, information technology (IT) equipment, operational technology (OT) equipment and services. In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, IT equipment manufacturers, OT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customers’ knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries’ laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign government’s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.\n\nWhen procuring applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services, it is important for an organisation to choose vendors that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products. This will assist not only with reducing the potential number of vulnerabilities, but also increasing the likelihood that timely patches, updates or vendor mitigations will be released to remediate any vulnerabilities that are found. Furthermore, it is important for an organisation to choose suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to transparency and that have a strong track record of maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains. In support of this, suppliers should openly provide evidence of their implementation of such commitments, especially when requested by their customers. Finally, a shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers and their customers can be highly beneficial and should be created and shared between both parties."

            "prose" : "Obligations for protecting data are no different when using a managed service or cloud service than when using an in-house service. As such, contractual arrangements with service providers should address how data entrusted to them, including to any of their subcontractors, will be protected during contractual arrangements and following the completion or termination of such contractual arrangements. However, in some cases an organisation may require managed services or cloud services to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by a service provider. In such cases, contractual arrangements with service providers should include appropriate timeframes for the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.\n\nIn addition, although data ownership resides with service providers’ customers, this can become less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, an organisation can document the types of data and its ownership in contractual arrangements with service providers.\n\nFurthermore, an organisation may make the decision to move from their current service provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may involve changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service providers can assist their customers by ensuring data is as portable as possible and that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary formats may make it more difficult for an organisation to perform backup, service migration or service decommissioning activities.\n\nFinally, to ensure that an organisation is given sufficient time to download their data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering a particular service, a one-month notification period should be documented in contractual arrangements with service providers."

As such, it is important that they are developed by personnel with a good understanding of business requirements, technologies being used and cybersecurity matters.\n\nSystem-specific cybersecurity documentation may be presented in a number of formats, including in wikis or other forms of document repositories. Furthermore, depending on the documentation framework used, details common to multiple systems could be consolidated into higher level cybersecurity documentation.\n\n# Further information\n\nTo assist with the development of system-specific cybersecurity documentation, a system security plan annex template, and an equivalent cloud controls matrix template, are available from the Australian Signals Directorate’s [Information security manual](#e7ce6e23-4bbb-45c1-a657-7e563c0837ed) webpage."

Measures to monitor and manage vulnerabilities in systems can also provide an organisation with a wealth of valuable information about their exposure to cyberthreats, as well as assisting them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking continuous monitoring activities is important as cyberthreats and the effectiveness of controls will change over time.\n\nThree types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability scans, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. A vulnerability scan involves using software tools to conduct automated checks for known vulnerabilities whereas a vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review of a system’s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment. In each case, the goal is to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however is designed to exercise real-world scenarios in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data. Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel can be internal to an organisation or from a third party. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken in an objective manner."

This can be achieved by preventing sensitive or classified data from being stored on hard drives, storing user profiles and documents on network shares, removing temporary user data at logoff, scrubbing virtual memory at shut down, and sanitising memory at shut down. It should be noted though that there is no guarantee that such measures will always work effectively or will not be bypassed due to unexpected circumstances, such as the loss of power. Therefore, hard drives in such cases will retain their sensitivity or classification for the purposes of reuse, reclassification, declassification, sanitisation, destruction and disposal."

            "prose" : "Business email compromise, a form of financial fraud, is when malicious actors attempt to scam an organisation out of money or assets with the assistance of a compromised email account. Malicious actors will typically attempt to achieve this via invoice fraud, employee impersonation or company impersonation.\n\nWith invoice fraud, malicious actors will compromise a vendor’s email account and through it have access to legitimate invoices. Malicious actors will then edit contact and bank details on invoices and send them to customers with the compromised email account. Customers will then pay the invoices, thinking that they are paying the vendor, but instead be sending money to malicious actors’ bank accounts.\n\nWith employee impersonation, malicious actors will compromise an organisation’s email account and impersonate an employee via email. This is then used to commit financial fraud in a number of ways. One common method is to impersonate a person in a position of authority, such as a chief executive officer or chief financial officer, and have a false invoice raised. Another method is to request a change to an employee’s banking details. The funds from the false invoice or the employee’s salary are then sent to malicious actors’ bank accounts.\n\nWith company impersonation, malicious actors register a domain with a name similar to another organisation. Malicious actors then impersonate that organisation in an email to a vendor and requests a quote for a quantity of expensive assets, such as laptop computers, and subsequently negotiate for the assets to be delivered to them prior to payment. The assets are then delivered to a location specified by malicious actors, with the invoice being sent to the legitimate organisation who never ordered or received the assets.\n\nTo mitigate business email compromise, personnel should be educated to look for the following warning signs:\n\n- an unexpected request for a change of banking details\n- an urgent payment request, or threats of serious consequences if payment is not made\n- unexpected payment requests from a person in a position of authority, particularly if payment requests are unusual from this person\n- an email received from a suspicious email address, such as an email address not matching an organisation’s name.\n\nIn dealing with such situations, personnel should have clear guidance to verify bank account details; think critically before actioning unusual payment requests; and have a process to report threatening demands for immediate action, pressure for secrecy, or requests to circumvent normal business processes and procedures."

As such, ensuring that privileged user accounts are prevented from accessing the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised. However, if privileged user accounts are explicitly authorised to access online services, they should be strictly limited to only what is required for users and services to undertake their duties.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing privileged access events, as well as privileged user account and security group management events, can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

            "prose" : "It is important that an organisation does not lose access to their systems. As such, an organisation should always have a method for gaining access during emergencies. Typically, emergencies would occur when access to systems cannot be gained via normal authentication processes, such as due to misconfigurations of authentication services, misconfigurations of security settings or due to a cybersecurity incident. In these situations, a break glass account (also known as an emergency access account) can be used to gain access. As break glass accounts have the highest level of privileges available for systems, extreme care should be taken to protect them, as well as monitor them for any signs of compromise or abuse.\n\nWhen break glass accounts are used, any administrative activities performed will not be directly attributable to an individual, and systems may not generate event logs. As such, additional controls need to be implemented in order to maintain the system’s integrity. In doing so, an organisation should ensure that any administrative activities performed using a break glass account are identified and documented in support of change management processes and procedures. This includes documenting the individual using the break glass account, the reason for using the break glass account and any administrative activities performed using the break glass account.\n\nAs the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows the break glass account’s credentials, credentials will need to be changed and tested by custodians after any authorised access by another party. Modern password managers that support automated credential changes and testing can assist in reducing the administrative overhead of such activities.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing break glass account events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

While enterprise mobility has traditionally been used to refer to the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptop computers, it is increasingly being applied to the use of desktop computers as part of working from home arrangements.\n\nThis section applies to mobile devices and desktop computers that use either a mobile operating system or a desktop operating system.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on allowing the use of privately-owned mobile devices and desktop computers by personnel to access their organisation’s systems or data can be found in the Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD) [Bring your own device for executives](#0e982561-93dc-4cf7-9a98-e91411e99ca6) publication.\n\nFurther information and specific guidance on enterprise mobility can be found in ASD’s [Risk management of enterprise mobility (including bring your own device)](#e8ec7a1f-775d-4b79-a164-0752278177fa) publication.\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on the procurement and use of online services can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28)."

As such, an organisation should seek legal advice to ascertain whether this scenario affects compliance with relevant legislation, such as the [Privacy Act 1988](#6fac5a84-b86e-405f-b2b3-8c13ecee4a02) and the [Archives Act 1983](#e0d3b5ea-6a5a-400c-8daa-8a8059816a06). Furthermore, if an organisation chooses to allow personnel to use privately-owned mobile devices or desktop computers to access their organisation’s classified systems or data, they should ensure that it does not present an unacceptable security risk. This can be achieved in part through the enforced separation of classified data from personal data as well as by preventing the storage of any classified data on privately-owned mobile devices and desktop computers."

Although an organisation may initially provide secure mobile devices, their security posture may degrade over time if personnel are capable of installing non-approved applications and disabling or modifying security functionality. Furthermore, it is important that security updates are applied to mobile devices as soon as they become available in order to maintain their security posture."

To assist in providing this assurance, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) performs evaluations for products used to protect SECRET and TOP SECRET data via its High Assurance Evaluation Program.\n\n# Common Criteria evaluations\n\nThe Australian Certification Authority within ASD certifies product evaluations conducted by licensed commercial facilities, in accordance with the Common Criteria (i.e. the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 15408 series), as part of the Australian Information Security Evaluation Program (AISEP).\n\nFor an organisation seeking to procure evaluated products, the Common Criteria’s [Certified Products List](#29b04eaf-5f57-4ea1-a453-8047826dccf5) contains a list of products that have been evaluated, certified and mutually-recognised in accordance with the Common Criteria and the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA).\n\n# Cryptographic evaluations\n\nSome CCRA schemes leverage the [Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program](#42e7d99d-9709-4355-a54d-98959c552aa1) for the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms used by cryptographic modules within evaluated products. In such cases, cryptographic evaluations are performed by Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories that are accredited by the United States’ National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program to International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 17025:2017, [General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories](#edd67903-94ef-4edd-9789-73e0141cd77c).\n\n# Protection Profiles\n\nA Protection Profile (PP) is a technology-specific document that defines the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluated product to mitigate specific cyberthreats. PPs can be published by a recognised CCRA scheme or by the CCRA body itself. PPs published by the CCRA body are referred to as collaborative PPs.\n\nASD recognises all collaborative PPs listed on the Common Criteria website, and will consider national PPs listed on the United States’ National Information Assurance Partnership website, in addition to those listed on ASD’s AISEP webpage. Where a PP does not exist, an evaluation based on an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) may be accepted. Such evaluations are capped at EAL2+ as this represents the best balance between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.\n\n# Evaluation documentation\n\nAn organisation choosing to use Common Criteria evaluated products can determine their suitability by reviewing their evaluation documentation.

Many settings exist within IT equipment to allow them to be configured in an approved secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and vendors often produce hardening guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of IT equipment. Note, however, in situations where ASD and vendor hardening guidance conflicts, precedence should be given to implementing the most restrictive guidance."

When done properly, such as using non-rewritable compact discs that have been finalised, this will ensure that data from the destination system cannot be accidently transferred, or maliciously exfiltrated, onto the media used for the data transfer and then onto another system, such as the original source system. Alternatively, if suitable write-once media is not used, the destination system should have a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured, such as via a read-only device or hardware write-blocker. However, the use of read-only mechanisms is not immune to failure or compromise, therefore, rewritable media should still be sanitised following each data transfer.\n\nIt is important to note that for most non-volatile flash memory media, it will be possible to sanitise and reclassify it following a data transfer in order to allow it to be connected to other systems again. This is not possible for SECRET and TOP SECRET non-volatile flash memory media as it cannot be reclassified following sanitisation."

While non-volatile magnetic tape and floppy disks can be sanitised by overwriting them at least once (or three times if pre-2001 or under 15 GB) in their entirety with a random pattern followed by a read back for verification, additional considerations apply to non-volatile magnetic hard drives due to their use of a host-protected area, device configuration overlay table and growth defects table.\n\nThe host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard drives are normally not visible to a computer’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or operating system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of non-volatile magnetic hard drives will leave any data contained in sectors listed in the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset non-volatile magnetic hard drives to their default state, thereby removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of non-volatile magnetic hard drives during subsequent sanitisation processes.\n\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or ‘g-list’. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added to the growth defects table, sanitising the non-volatile magnetic hard drive will not overwrite such data. While these sectors may be considered bad by non-volatile magnetic hard drives, quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability to read or write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command was built into the firmware of post-2001 non-volatile magnetic hard drives and is able to access sectors that have been added to the growth defects table.\n\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives also contain a primary defects table or ‘p-list’. The primary defects table contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes. No data is ever stored in sectors listed in the primary defects table as they are marked as inaccessible before non-volatile magnetic hard drives are used for the first time."

When degaussing magnetic media, care needs to be taken as a degausser of insufficient magnetic field strength will not be effective. In addition, since 2006 perpendicular magnetic media has progressively replaced longitudinal magnetic media. As some older degaussers are only capable of destroying longitudinal magnetic media, care needs to be taken to ensure that a degausser with a suitable magnetic orientation is also used. Furthermore, to ensure that degaussers are being used in the correct manner to effectively destroy magnetic media, product-specific directions provided by degausser manufacturers should be followed. Finally, to provide an additional level of assurance following the use of a degausser, magnetic media should be physically damaged by deforming any internal platters."

When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm files), HTML applications (e.g. .hta files), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl files) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.\n\nIn implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by malicious actors.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing application control events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

However, PowerShell can also be a dangerous exploitation tool in the hands of malicious actors.\n\nIn order to prevent attacks leveraging vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 should be disabled or removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between security and functionality.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing PowerShell events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

Many forms of malicious code are designed specifically to take advantage of this by using common protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or Domain Name System. Software firewalls are more effective than traditional network firewalls as they can control which applications and services can communicate to and from workstations and servers. As such, a software firewall should be implemented on workstations and servers to restrict inbound and outbound network connections to an organisation-approved set of applications and services."

Many settings exist within such applications to allow them to be configured in an approved secure state in order to minimise this security risk.

Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, malicious actors can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do."

This can be especially risky for server applications as such applications are routinely targeted for exploitation. Many settings exist within server applications to allow them to be configured in an approved secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, ASD and vendors often produce hardening guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of server applications.

This may include:\n\n- something users know, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)\n- something users have, such as a security key, smart card, passkey, smartphone or one-time password token\n- something users are, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.\n\nUsers of online services, privileged users of systems and users with access to data repositories are more likely to be targeted by malicious actors due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these user accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing malicious actors’ ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.\n\nWhen implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something users have should be used with something users know. Alternatively, something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (often known as passwordless multi-factor authentication) can be used. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication is recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing multi-factor authentication events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

When malicious actors gain access to a list of usernames and hashed credentials from a system, they can attempt to recover username and credential pairs by comparing the hashes of known credentials with the hashed credentials they have gained access to. By finding a match malicious actors will know the credential associated with a given username.\n\nIn order to reduce this security risk, an organisation should implement multi-factor authentication. Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable for protecting sensitive or classified systems, it may not be possible to implement multi-factor authentication on some systems. In such cases, an organisation will need to increase the time on average it takes malicious actors to compromise a credential by continuing to increase its length over time. Such increases in length can be balanced against useability through the use of passphrases rather than passwords. In cases where systems do not support passphrases, and as an absolute last resort, the strongest password length and password complexity supported by a system will need to be implemented.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing single-factor authentication events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

As such, it is critical that credentials for the built-in Administrator account, break glass accounts, local administrator accounts and service accounts in each domain are long, unique, unpredictable and managed.\n\nTo provide additional security and credential management functionality for service accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts to Microsoft Windows Server. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service Accounts do not require manual credential management by system administrators, as the operating system automatically ensures that they are long, unique, unpredictable and managed. This ensures that service account credentials are secure, not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular basis. However, in cases where the use of group Managed Service Accounts is not possible, credentials for service accounts should still be unique, unpredictable and random with a minimum length of 30 characters."

In addition, physical credentials, such as written down credentials (e.g. memorised secrets) and dedicated devices that store or generate credentials (e.g. security keys, smart cards and one-time password tokens), when kept together with systems they are used to authenticate to, can increase the likelihood of malicious actors gaining unauthorised access to systems. For example, when smart cards are left on card readers, one-time password tokens are left in laptop computer bags, security keys are left connected to computers or passphrases are written down and stuck to computer monitors. To reduce this security risk, physical credentials should be keep separate from systems they are used to authenticate to, except for when performing authentication activities.\n\nIf storing credentials on systems, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched.\n\nWhen using Microsoft Windows systems, memory integrity, Local Security Authority protection, Credential Guard and Remote Credential Guard functionality, all preferably with a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) lock, can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials. In addition, malicious actors that have access to systems may attempt to steal cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.\n\nFinally, an organisation should regularly scan their systems to detect and remediate any credentials that are being stored in an unprotected manner, such as in the clear in documents, on network file shares or in other data repositories."

In doing so, Type 1 hypervisors should be treated as operating systems while Type 2 hypervisors should be treated as applications. Note, as Type 1 hypervisors are themselves lightweight operating systems, they can be treated as a combination of a software-based isolation mechanism and an underlying operating system. Conversely, Type 2 hypervisors will run on top of a general-purpose operating system that may be provided by a different vendor to that of the software-isolation mechanism.\n\n# Containerisation\n\nContainers allow for versatile deployment of systems and, in doing so, should be treated the same as any other system. However, controls in a containerised environment may take a different form when compared to other types of systems. For example, patching the operating system of a workstation may be performed differently to ensuring that a patched image is used for a container, however, the principle is the same. In general, the same security risks that apply to non-containerised systems will likely apply to containerised systems.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on container security can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-190, [Application Container Security Guide](#887c65c3-c853-41c6-89d5-3f297108889e).\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on vendors that have made a pledge to implement Secure by Design and Secure by Default principles and practices can be found on the United States’ Cybersecurity \\& Infrastructure Security Agency’s [Secure by Design Pledge](#4974639a-f41a-4280-ae06-33d1f13d6083) website.\n\nFurther information on the use of cloud services can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on hardening operating systems can be found in the operating system hardening section of these guidelines.\n\nFurther information on patching or updating operating systems and applications can be found in the system patching section of the [Guidelines for system management](#c6ca6620-ccd5-4c5d-b97c-9d92f1162948).\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the [Guidelines for system monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on hypervisor security can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-125A Rev. 1, [Security Recommendations for Server-based Hypervisor Platforms](#33d26cdd-51fc-45d3-a026-0814d51a4c7e)."

In doing so, a computing environment could consist of an entire operating system installed in a virtual machine where the isolation mechanism is a hypervisor, such as cloud services providing Infrastructure as a Service, or alternatively, a computing environment could consist of an application which uses the shared kernel of the underlying operating system of the physical server where the isolation mechanism is an application container or application sandbox, such as cloud services providing Platform as a Service. Note, however, the logical separation of data within a single application, such as cloud services providing Software as a Service, is not considered to be the same as multiple computing environments.\n\nMalicious actors who have compromised a single computing environment, or who legitimately control a single computing environment, might exploit a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the isolation mechanism to compromise other computing environments on the same physical server or compromise the underlying operating system of the physical server.

In doing so, the use of a jump server (also known as a jump host or jump box) that allows only necessary ports and services to be used can be an effective way of simplifying and securing administrative activities. Specifically, a jump server can provide filtering of network management traffic while also acting as a focal point to perform multi-factor authentication; store and manage administrative tools; and perform logging, monitoring and alerting activities. In addition, using separate jump servers for the administration of critical servers (such as Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services domain controllers, Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services Certification Authority servers, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services servers and Microsoft Entra Connect servers), high-value servers (such as Domain Name System servers, database servers, email servers, file servers and web servers) and regular servers can further assist in protecting these assets."

Ideally, vulnerability scanning should be conducted in an automated manner and take place at twice the frequency in which patches or updates need to be applied. For example, if patches or updates are to be applied within two weeks of release then vulnerability scanning should be undertaken at least weekly."

This is especially important when vulnerabilities are assessed as critical by vendors or working exploits exist.\n\nIf no patches or updates are available for vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available.

Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.\n\nIf a patch or update is released for high assurance IT equipment, ASD will conduct an assessment of the patch or update.

As such, common security risks associated with their use should be mitigated during their development, especially for network APIs that are accessible over the internet. In particular, this includes mitigating poorly secured network APIs that facilitate unauthorised modification of data or access to data not authorised for release into the public domain. In such cases, ensuring authentication and authorisation of clients is performed when clients call network APIs can assist in mitigating unauthorised modification of, or access to, data. Finally, centrally logging and analysing network API use can assist in detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

Furthermore, when database queries from software fail, they may display detailed error information about the structure of databases. This can be used by malicious actors to further tailor their SQL injection attacks.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing all queries to databases from software that are initiated by users can assist in monitoring the security posture of databases, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cybersecurity incidents."

            "prose" : "Implementing a vulnerability disclosure program, based on responsible disclosure, can assist an organisation to improve the security of their products and services as it provides a way for security researchers and other members of the public to responsibly notify them of vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, following the verification and resolution of reported vulnerabilities, it can assist an organisation in notifying their customers of vulnerabilities that have been discovered in their products and services, and any patches, updates or vendor mitigations that should be applied.\n\nA vulnerability disclosure program should include processes and procedures for receiving, verifying, resolving and reporting vulnerabilities disclosed by internal and external parties. In support of this, a vulnerability disclosure policy should be made publicly available that covers:\n\n- the purpose of the vulnerability disclosure program\n- types of security research that are and are not allowed\n- how to report any vulnerabilities\n- actions, and associated timeframes, upon notification of vulnerabilities\n- expectations regarding the public disclosure of vulnerabilities\n- any recognition or reward for finders of vulnerabilities.\n\nFinally, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) encourages security researchers and other members of the public to responsibly report vulnerabilities directly to an organisation. However, ASD recognises that this is not always practical, initial attempts at communication may be unsuccessful or the person making the report may not wish to do so directly. In such cases, vulnerabilities can be reported to ASD as an independent coordinator. Note, under ASD’s limited use obligation, information voluntarily provided to ASD about vulnerabilities cannot be used for regulatory purposes."

In such situations, where practical and feasible, an organisation should consider transitioning to the use of alternative protocols that support encryption."

As such, an organisation exclusively using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) should disable IPv6. This will assist in minimising the attack surface of networks and ensure that IPv6 cannot be exploited by malicious actors.\n\nTo aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, numerous tunnelling protocols have been developed to allow interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6. Disabling IPv6 tunnelling protocols on networks that do not require such functionality will prevent malicious actors from bypassing traditional network defences by encapsulating IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets.\n\nStateless Address Autoconfiguration is a method of stateless Internet Protocol (IP) address configuration in IPv6 networks. Notably, it reduces the ability of an organisation to maintain effective logs of IP address assignments on networks. For this reason, stateless IP addressing should be avoided."

As such, it is important to harden the settings of wireless access points prior to their deployment in networks. In addition, some wireless access points come with default Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs). As default SSIDs are often documented on the internet, it is important to change default SSIDs of wireless access points.\n\nWhen changing default SSIDs, it is important that new SSIDs do not bring undue attention to an organisation’s wireless networks. In doing so, SSIDs of wireless networks should not be readily associated with an organisation, the location of their premises or the functionality of wireless networks.\n\nA method commonly recommended to lower the profile of wireless networks is disabling SSID broadcasting. While this ensures that the existence of wireless networks are not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, SSIDs are still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests. As such, it is easy to determine SSIDs of wireless networks by capturing these requests and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting, an organisation will make it more difficult for users to connect to wireless networks. Furthermore, malicious actors could configure a malicious wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as a hidden SSID used by a legitimate wireless network, thereby fooling users or devices into automatically connecting to the malicious wireless access point instead. In doing so, malicious actors could steal authentication credentials in order to gain access to the legitimate wireless network."

A number of EAP methods supported by WPA2 and WPA3 are available.\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) is considered one of the most secure EAP methods and is widely supported. It uses a Public Key Infrastructure to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an organisation to have established a Public Key Infrastructure. This involves deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or sourcing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses their wireless networks. While this introduces additional costs and management overheads, the security advantages are significant."

In addition, to reduce the likelihood of stolen smart cards from being used to gain unauthorised access to wireless networks, multi-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of personal identification numbers on smart cards.

When devices roam away from wireless access points they have authenticated to, they will not need to perform a full re-authentication should they roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate devices to neighbouring wireless access points that devices might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for devices each time they roam between wireless access points is ideal, an organisation can choose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming.

For example, an organisation and their cloud service providers may discuss whether dedicated communication links or connections over the internet will be used and whether any secondary communications links will provide sufficient capacity to maintain operational requirements should the primary communication link become unavailable.\n\nFurthermore, capacity and availability monitoring should be performed in order to manage workloads and monitor the health of online services. This can be achieved through continuous real-time monitoring of metrics, such as latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput and availability. In addition, feedback should be provided to cloud service providers when performance does not meet service level agreement targets. To assist with this, anomaly detection can be performed through network telemetry that is integrated into security monitoring tools."

However, the services offered by CDNs can include more than basic content hosting, such as web response caching, load balancing, web application security and denial-of-service attack mitigations.\n\nIn using CDNs, care should be taken with their configuration to ensure that the IP addresses of an organisation’s web servers (referred to as origin servers) are not identifiable by malicious actors, as knowledge of origin server IP addresses could allow for protections provided by CDNs to be bypassed.

To achieve this goal, malicious actors may use a number of methods to deny access to legitimate users of online services. This includes using multiple computers to direct a large volume of unwanted network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume all available network bandwidth, using multiple computers to direct tailored network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume all processing resources, or hijacking online services in an attempt to redirect legitimate users away from those services to other services that malicious actors control.\n\nAs an organisation often cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks, they should discuss with their cloud service providers any denial-of-service attack detection and monitoring services that may be available for their use. For example, reporting dashboards that provide out-of-band and real-time alerts based on organisation-defined notification thresholds. Furthermore, an organisation should discuss with their cloud service providers what mitigation strategies they can implement to prepare for, and reduce the impact of, being targeted by a denial-of-service attack. Finally, with the express consent of their cloud service providers, an organisation may seek to test the effectiveness of any denial-of-service attack mitigation strategies that have been implemented.\n\nOverall, preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur, such as by identifying critical online services and implementing preventative denial-of-service attack mitigation strategies, is by far the best approach as it is very difficult to respond to denial-of-service attacks once they begin and efforts at that stage are unlikely to be effective."

In doing so, confidentiality protects data by making it unreadable to all but authorised entities, integrity protects data from accidental or deliberate manipulation by entities, authentication ensures that an entity is who they claim to be, and non-repudiation provides proof that an entity performed a particular action.\n\n# Using encryption\n\nEncryption of data at rest can be used to protect sensitive or classified data stored on information technology (IT) equipment and media. In addition, encryption of data in transit can be used to protect sensitive or classified data communicated over public network infrastructure. However, when an organisation uses encryption for data at rest, or data in transit, they are not reducing the sensitivity or classification of the data, they are simply reducing the immediate consequences of the data being accessed by malicious actors.\n\n# International standards for cryptographic modules\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 19790:2012, [Information technology – Security techniques – Security requirements for cryptographic modules](#a07c439d-b2f4-4ee2-b56e-f17000f3722f), and ISO/IEC 24759:2017, [Information technology – Security techniques – Test requirements for cryptographic modules](#aaf83df2-02e3-4f9f-bdf5-33fbff42842d), are international standards for the design and validation of hardware and software cryptographic modules.\n\nFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3, [Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules](#32c8fa3a-45bb-4f88-baee-73a7696aa2ad) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 180-140, [FIPS 140-3 Derived Test Requirements (DTR): CMVP Validation Authority Updates to ISO/IEC 24759](#197db872-c6a9-4b29-9888-1552e908252c) are United States standards based upon ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and ISO/IEC 24759:2017.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cryptographic key management practices can be found in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5, [Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 – General](#ffc8a1f6-f4e3-4ff5-a7f9-f41f766274eb).\n\nFurther information on cryptographic key management practices for HACE is available from ASD.\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on evaluated products can be found in the evaluated product procurement section of the [Guidelines for evaluated products](#a699a3aa-828d-479b-b50b-98127bb19437).\n\nFurther information on the evaluation of cryptographic modules, including testing requirements, is available as part of the [Cryptographic Module Validation Program](#28cd91d2-e5cb-4896-bcfc-abb32e05e61d) which is jointly operated by NIST and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.\n\nFurther information on the protection of IT equipment and media can be found in the Department of Home Affairs’ [Protective Security Policy Framework](#92679127-f61d-486a-a93e-df2a26dfb07a)."

Further information on high assurance cryptographic algorithms can be obtained from ASD.\n\n# ASD-Approved Cryptographic Algorithms\n\nThere is no guarantee of a cryptographic algorithm’s resistance to currently unknown attacks. However, the cryptographic algorithms listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting. Approval for the use of the cryptographic algorithms listed in this section is limited to cases where they are implemented in accordance with these guidelines.\n\nThe approved asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are:\n\n- Diffie-Hellman (DH) for agreeing on encryption session keys\n- Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for agreeing on encryption session keys\n- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for digital signatures\n- Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) for digital signatures\n- Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) for encapsulating encryption session keys (and similar keys)\n- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) for digital signatures and transporting encryption session keys (and similar keys).\n\nThe only approved hashing algorithm for general purpose use is Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2). However, Secure Hashing Algorithm 3 (SHA-3), including its extendable-output functions (XOFs), is approved exclusively for use within ML-DSA and ML-KEM.\n\nThe only approved symmetric cryptographic algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\nWhere there is a range of key sizes for a cryptographic algorithm, some key sizes are not approved as they are insecure against current attacks or do not provide an adequate safety margin against possible future attacks. For example, advances in integer factorisation methods have rendered some RSA moduli sizes vulnerable and could render other RSA moduli vulnerable in the future.\n\nThe minimum targets used for the effective security strength of cryptographic algorithms listed within this section are:\n\n- 112 bits for non-classified data\n- 112 bits for OFFICIAL: Sensitive data\n- 112 bits for PROTECTED data\n- 128 bits for SECRET data\n- 192 bits for TOP SECRET data.\n\nNote, certain key sizes and parameters, such as specific elliptic curves, are preferred in order to promote interoperability with the United States’ National Security Agency’s [Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0](#e8a28fa5-4ea1-4ef5-a870-4d59e40fab37).\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on post-quantum traditional hybrid schemes can be found in the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre’s [Next steps in preparing for post-quantum cryptography](#b54cf0d1-d275-426e-98aa-9c678b9d55a5) guidance.\n\nFurther information on how to combine the different components of a post-quantum traditional hybrid scheme used for key encapsulation can be found in NIST SP 800-56C Rev. 2, [Recommendation for Key-Derivation Methods in Key-Establishment Schemes](#a75de67b-9502-47e9-b48b-5e2a45d528e1). Note, this publication does not pertain to post-quantum traditional hybrid schemes used for digital signatures.\n\nFurther information on planning for the transition to post-quantum cryptography can be found in ASD’s [Planning for post-quantum cryptography](#0b1a477d-b08a-4491-9cfc-c9d435b28dc8) publication."

The ML-DSA standard contains three different parameter sets: ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87. The use of ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87 are approved. However, for interoperability and maintainability reasons, ML-DSA-65 will not be approved beyond 2030.\n\nWhen using ML-DSA for digital signing, it may either be hedged or deterministic. Notably, the hedged variant provides effective protection from certain side-channel attacks which apply to the deterministic variant. For this reason, the hedged variant should be used whenever possible. The deterministic variant should not be used unless the nature of the digital signing platform renders the creation of random data infeasible, which is a mandatory step for the hedged variant.\n\nWhen using ML-DSA for digital signing, signing a message first involves hashing the message using SHAKE128 or SHAKE256. In environments where the message being hashed is large, and the digital signing platform lacks hardware support for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, pre-hashed variants of ML-DSA might be used to reduce computational overheads. In such cases, pre-hashed variants of ML-DSA take as their input a hash of the message as computed by an alternative, and less computationally expensive, hashing algorithm. In such cases, care should be taken to ensure that an appropriate alternative hashing algorithm is being used, such as a SHA-2 hashing algorithm. In such cases, the hash used should be twice as long as the desired effective security strength. In practice, this requires the use of at least SHA-384 for the pre-hashed variant of ML-DSA-65 and at the use of at least SHA-512 for the pre-hashed variant of ML-DSA-87."

While the direct impact of these quantum attacks varies across different cryptographic algorithms, there is a stark difference in impact between asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and symmetric cryptographic algorithms.\n\nOne known quantum attack (using Shor's algorithm) effectively defeats all traditional cryptography that relies upon asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as DH, ECDH, ECDSA or RSA. The efficiency of this is such that it is infeasible to securely use these AACAs in the presence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC). While a CRQC does not currently exist, the trajectory of technological advances in quantum computing means that these AACAs will need to be phased out in favour of alternative AACAs that offer greater protection. As such, the development or procurement of new cryptographic equipment and software, which is intended to be used beyond 2030, should be undertaken with the goal of supporting ASD-approved post-quantum cryptographic algorithms by 2030.\n\nThe impact of quantum attacks on hashing algorithms and symmetric cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-2 and AES, is unlikely to be felt for some time. However, for interoperability reasons, the design and provision of new cryptographic equipment and software, which is intended to be used beyond 2030, should support SHA-384, SHA-512 and AES-256."

Generally, such schemes have the advantage of the security offered by the traditional cryptographic algorithm in the event that the post-quantum cryptographic algorithm is vulnerable to an implementation flaw or new attack. This advantage comes at the cost of increased complexity, making maintenance, analysis and secure implementation more difficult, as well as having greater computational and bandwidth overheads.\n\nThe use of post-quantum traditional hybrid schemes is not recommended, however, it is not prohibited. If such schemes are to be used, at least one of the post-quantum or traditional cryptographic algorithms, or both, should be an AACA. It is important to note though, that in the presence of a CRQC, the security of such schemes are reduced to that provided by the post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. As such, there is no practical value in the use of such schemes in the presence of a CRQC.

However, Secure Sockets Layer and TLS version 1.2 and earlier are no longer considered suitable for use as an AACP. As such, an organisation implementing TLS should use only the latest version of TLS (i.e. TLS version 1.3). In addition, a number of security risks exist when TLS is configured in an insecure manner. To mitigate these security risks, TLS clients and servers should be configured to enforce secure settings at the time of the TLS handshake. In situations where this is not possible, such as for some multi-tenancy environments (e.g. content delivery networks), additional controls will need to be implemented. For example, by further restricting the permitted TLS configuration within Layer 7 authorisation logic."

In doing so, gateways take on the highest sensitivity or classification of connected security domains.\n\nThis section describes controls applicable to all types of gateways. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of gateways being deployed and the security domains involved. For example, the Cross Domain Solutions section should be consulted for gateways between different security domains where at least one security domain is classified SECRET or TOP SECRET.\n\nPersonnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of gateways should also refer to the Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD) [Gateway security guidance package](#3df21b72-0559-4bbf-a990-5ee509f70747).\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on the procurement of outsourced services can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on designing, configuring and managing networks can be found in the network design and configuration section of the [Guidelines for networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on privileged access to systems can be found in the access to systems and their resources section of the [Guidelines for personnel security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2).\n\nFurther information on cybersecurity awareness training can be found in the cybersecurity awareness training section of the [Guidelines for personnel security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2).\n\nFurther information on authenticating users can be found in the authentication hardening section of the [Guidelines for system hardening](#de7525f3-a466-40a5-abdd-3ae24a6d1b44).\n\nFurther information on authenticating IT equipment can be found in the network design and configuration section of the [Guidelines for networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on [RPKI](#7da35efd-7196-4aba-bd79-30c19e8ef48b) and [ROA records](#355b47b5-6253-4be5-ba7c-274833d84b75) is available from the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre.\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the [Guidelines for system monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on [the purpose of IRAP](#84d3cbab-ab84-4981-a4f7-2bd469c8deaf), and [a list of current IRAP assessors](#bdd11ace-cb4e-470a-92ad-556c79b6c14a), is available from ASD."

In doing so, it is important that gateways are used not only between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, but also between an organisation’s networks that belong to different security domains and between an organisation’s networks and other organisations’ networks that are connected via means other than public network infrastructure.\n\nWhen implementing gateways between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, an organisation should place any services that external parties require access to within a demilitarised zone. This can mitigate security risks for an organisation when hosting such services in an internet-accessible manner.\n\nFinally, in architecting gateways, it is important that they only allow explicitly authorised data flows. In support of this, gateways should inspect and filter data flows at the transport and above network layers. Furthermore, gateways should be capable of performing ingress traffic filtering to detect and prevent Internet Protocol (IP) source address spoofing."

This allows an organisation, particularly a telecommunications carrier or cloud service provider, to verify routing data they receive, transmit and process in order to determine routing calculations for internet traffic. By using RPKI, an organisation may reduce Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-related cyberthreats, such as some types of denial-of-service attacks, accidental or deliberate rerouting of internet traffic, and opportunities for the undermining of IP address-based reputational services. RPKI Route Origin Authorization (ROA) records, which describe routes in terms of network/prefix and Autonomous Systems from which they are expected to originate, should be configured for the public IP addresses controlled by, or used by, an organisation. ROA records should also be configured for the unannounced IP address space controlled by an organisation.\n\nRoute Origin Validation (ROV) is a mechanism that enables the validation of ROA covered IP addresses received via BGP. For increased BGP security, ROV should be implemented with all routing data received from transit providers being filtered. In doing so, any routes received that are invalid, or have multiple transit providers where one them does not implement ROV, should be rejected or deprioritised. In cases where an organisation chooses to deprioritise invalid routes to meet specific operational requirements, as opposed to rejecting them, such decisions should be regularly reviewed noting valid routes should always be prioritised over those that are not.\n\nFinally, an organisation should consider the inclusion of routing security measures as part of procurement and contract requirements to ensure such functionality is available for their use."

          "prose" : "# Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions\n\nA Cross Domain Solution (CDS) is a system comprised of security-enforcing functions tailored to mitigate specific security risks associated with accessing or transferring data between different security domains. CDSs may be an integrated appliance or, more commonly, be composed of discrete technologies or sub-systems, with each sub-system consisting of hardware or software components.\n\nThis section describes the controls applicable to CDSs and extends upon the prior gateways section. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of CDSs being deployed.\n\nPersonnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of CDSs should also refer to ASD’s [Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions](#86847be4-3a06-4d2f-9952-447158593e0d) and [Fundamentals of Cross Domain Solutions](#f32020e9-4cb3-486b-bcbb-6fb6719f58a5) publications.\n\n# Types of Cross Domain Solutions\n\nThis section defines two types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs and Access CDSs. These definitions are closely aligned with how CDSs are described and sold by vendors. Note, however, vendors may also offer combined Access and Transfer CDSs.\n\nIn defining the functionality of different types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs facilitate the transfer of data in one direction (unidirectional) or multiple directions (bi-directional) between different security domains. In comparison, Access CDSs provide users with access to multiple security domains from a single device. However, while Access CDSs allow interaction with different security domains, they do not allow users to move data between the different security domains.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the [Guidelines for procurement and outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on evaluated products can be found in the evaluated product procurement section of the [Guidelines for evaluated products](#a699a3aa-828d-479b-b50b-98127bb19437).\n\nFurther information on designing, configuring and managing networks can be found in the network design and configuration section of the [Guidelines for networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the [Guidelines for system monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on cybersecurity awareness training can be found in the cybersecurity awareness training section of the [Guidelines for personnel security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2)."

Finally, as users rarely have a requirement to access websites via their IP addresses instead of their domain names, the presence of such activities could indicate malicious code attempting to communicate with malicious actors’ command and control infrastructure and should be blocked."

Monitoring of such activities, via periodic verification of data transfer logs, can assist in identifying abuse of data transfer privileges and any unusual usage patterns that may indicate attempts by malicious actors to surreptitiously import malicious code or exfiltrate data from SECRET and TOP SECRET systems."
