These cyber security principles are grouped into four key activities: govern, protect, detect and respond.\n\n* Govern: Identifying and managing security risks.\n* Protect: Implementing controls to reduce security risks.\n* Detect: Detecting and understanding cyber security events to identify cyber security incidents.\n* Respond: Responding to and recovering from cyber security incidents.\n\n# Maturity modelling\n\nWhen implementing the cyber security principles, an organisation can use the following maturity model to assess the implementation of individual principles, groups of principles or the cyber security principles as a whole. The five levels in the maturity model are:\n\n* Incomplete: The cyber security principles are partially implemented or not implemented.\n* Initial: The cyber security principles are implemented, but in a poor or ad hoc manner.\n* Developing: The cyber security principles are sufficiently implemented, but on a project-by-project basis.\n* Managing: The cyber security principles are established as standard business practices and robustly implemented throughout the organisation.\n* Optimising: A deliberate focus on optimisation and continual improvement exists for the implementation of the cyber security principles throughout the organisation."

This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.\n\n# Detecting cyber security incidents\n\nOne of the core elements of detecting and investigating cyber security incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources. Fortunately, many data sources can be extracted from existing systems without requiring specialised capabilities.\n\nThe following are some of the data sources that an organisation can use for detecting and investigating cyber security incidents:\n\n* Domain Name System event logs: Can assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domain names or Internet Protocol addresses which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n* Email server event logs: Can assist in identifying users targeted with spear-phishing emails. Can also assist in identifying the initial vector of a compromise.\n* Gateway event logs: Can assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n* Operating system and application event logs: Can assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n* Remote access event logs: Can assist in identifying unusual source addresses, times of access and logon/logoff times associated with malicious activity.\n* Web proxy event logs: Can assist in identifying Hypertext Transfer Protocol-based vectors and malicious network traffic.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the\n[Guidelines for System Monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on incident response plans can be found in the system-specific security documentation section of the\n[Guidelines for Security Documentation](#578d0434-6b3f-46f3-aad8-c7ac75c2ebcc).\n\nFurther information on establishing and operating a trusted insider program can be found in the Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute’s\n[Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats](#cad720b4-e47a-437d-b272-6958e738131d) publication."

Specifically, using an alternative system to plan and coordinate intrusion remediation activities will prevent alerting the adversary if they have already compromised email, messaging or collaboration services. In addition, conducting intrusion remediation activities in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage will prevent forewarning the adversary, thereby depriving them of sufficient time to establish alternative access points or persistence methods on the system.\n\nFollowing intrusion remediation activities, an organisation should determine whether the adversary has been successfully removed from the system, including whether or not they have since reacquired access. This can be achieved, in part, by capturing and analysing network traffic for at least seven days following remediation activities."

In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, ICT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customers’ knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries’ laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign government’s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.\n\nIn managing cyber supply chain risks, it is important that an organisation preferences suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products and services – including throughout distribution channels. In addition, suppliers should have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains. Also, in some cases, a shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers and their customers can be highly beneficial."

As such, contractual arrangements with service providers should address how data entrusted to them, including to any of their subcontractors, will be protected both during contractual arrangements and following the completion or termination of contractual arrangements. However, in some cases an organisation may require managed services or cloud services to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by a service provider. In such cases, contractual arrangements with service providers should include appropriate timeframes for the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.\n\nIn addition, although data ownership resides with service providers’ customers, this can become less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, an organisation can document the types of data and its ownership in contractual arrangements with service providers.\n\nFurthermore, an organisation may make the decision to move from their current service provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may involve changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service providers can assist their customers by ensuring data is as portable as possible and that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary formats may make it more difficult for an organisation to perform backup, service migration or service decommissioning activities.\n\nFinally, to ensure that an organisation is given sufficient time to download their data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering a particular service, a one month notification period should be documented in contractual arrangements with service providers."

Measures to monitor and manage security vulnerabilities in systems can also provide an organisation with a wealth of valuable information about their exposure to cyber threats, as well as assisting them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking continuous monitoring activities is important as cyber threats and the effectiveness of controls will change over time.\n\nThree types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability assessments, vulnerability scans and penetration tests. A vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review of a system’s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment while a vulnerability scan involves using software tools to conduct automated checks for known security vulnerabilities. In each case, the goal is to identify as many security vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however is designed to exercise real-world scenarios in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data. Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel can be internal to an organisation or from a third party. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken in an objective manner."

            "prose" : "Business email compromise, a form of financial fraud, is when an adversary attempts to scam an organisation out of money or assets with the assistance of a compromised email account. An adversary will typically attempt to achieve this via invoice fraud, employee impersonation or company impersonation.\n\nWith invoice fraud, an adversary will compromise a vendor’s email account and through it have access to legitimate invoices. The adversary will then edit contact and bank details on invoices and send them to customers with the compromised email account. Customers will then pay the invoices, thinking that they are paying the vendor, but instead be sending money to the adversary’s bank account.\n\nWith employee impersonation, an adversary will compromise an organisation’s email account and impersonate an employee via email. This is then used to commit financial fraud in a number of ways. One common method is to impersonate a person in a position of authority, such as a Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, and have a false invoice raised. Another method is to request a change to an employee’s banking details. The funds from the false invoice or the employee's salary is then sent to the adversary’s bank account.\n\nWith company impersonation, an adversary registers a domain with a name similar to another organisation. The adversary then impersonates that organisation in an email to a vendor and requests a quote for a quantity of expensive assets, such as laptops, and subsequently negotiates for the assets to be delivered to them prior to payment. The assets are then delivered to a location specified by the adversary, with the invoice being sent to the legitimate organisation who never ordered or received the assets.\n\nTo mitigate business email compromise, personnel should be educated to look for the following warning signs:\n\n* an unexpected request for a change of banking details\n* an urgent payment request, or threats of serious consequences if payment is not made\n* unexpected payment requests from a person in a position of authority, particularly if payment requests are unusual from this person\n* an email received from a suspicious email address, such as an email address not matching an organisation’s name.\n\nIn dealing with such situations, personnel should have clear guidance to verify bank account details; think critically before actioning unusual payment requests; and have a process to report threatening demands for immediate action, pressure for secrecy, or requests to circumvent normal business processes and procedures."

This can also apply to users who have only limited privileges, such as software developers, but can still bypass controls. A privileged account often has the ability to modify system configurations, account privileges, event logs and security configurations for applications.\n\nPrivileged users, and in some cases privileged service accounts, are often targeted by an adversary as they can potentially give full access to systems. As such, ensuring that privileged accounts do not have the ability to access the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised.\n\nFinally, privileged access event logs, privileged account management event logs and privileged group management logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, privileged access event logs, privileged account management event logs and privileged group management logs should be captured and stored centrally."

Typically, emergencies would occur when access to systems cannot be gained via normal authentication processes, such as due to misconfigurations of authentication services, misconfigurations of security settings or due to a cyber security incident. In these situations, a break glass account (also known as an emergency access account) can be used to gain access. As break glass accounts generally have the highest level of privileges available for systems, extreme care should be taken to both protect them and to monitor for any signs of compromise or abuse.\n\nWhen break glass accounts are used, any administrative activities performed will not be directly attributable to an individual, and systems may not generate event logs. As such, additional controls need to be implemented in order to maintain the system’s integrity. In doing so, an organisation should ensure that any administrative activities performed using a break glass account are identified and documented in support of change management processes and procedures. This includes documenting the individual using the break glass account, the reason for using the break glass account and any administrative activities performed using the break glass account.\n\nAs the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows the account’s credentials, credentials will need to be changed and tested by custodians after any authorised access by another party. Modern password managers that support automated credential changes and testing can assist in reducing the administrative overhead of such activities.\n\nFinally, break glass event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, break glass event logs should be captured and stored centrally."

In addition, this section only applies to new cabling infrastructure installations or upgrades.\n\n# Shared facilities\n\nIn addition to common controls, this section provides additional controls for shared facilities, such as a single floor, or part of a floor, within a multi-tenanted building.\n\n# Cables and structured cabling systems\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a cable is defined as any fibre optic or copper material housed within a protective sheath for the purposes of transmitting data or control signals from one point in a facility to another. Each cable will form part of a structured cabling system and will need to comply with the Australian Standards associated with that system. In addition to network communications and data systems, some common building management structured cabling systems found within facilities are:\n\n* fire control and sensor systems\n* security control and surveillance systems\n* lighting control systems\n* access control systems\n* voice and emergency telephony systems\n* emergency control alert systems.\n\n# Cable sheaths and conduits\n\nA cable’s protective sheath is not considered to be a conduit.\n\n# Cable connector types\n\nThe same cable connector types can be used for all systems within a facility regardless of their sensitivity or classification.\n\n# Further information\n\n[Australian cabling standards and regulations](#7000d51a-6cca-40a0-95d9-f1f15048ea68) can be obtained from the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\nFurther information on SCEC-approved tamper-evident seals can be found on the SCEC’s\n[Security Equipment Evaluated Products List](#f7e13f7b-eb48-4294-bd01-9c22c756d96b).\n\nFurther information on audio secure rooms can be found in the Attorney-General’s Department’s\n[Protective Security Policy Framework](#92679127-f61d-486a-a93e-df2a26dfb07a),\n[Physical security for entity resources](#6e456a92-f405-4151-88ca-5621aa23519b) policy."

To assist in providing this assurance, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) performs product evaluations through the following programs:\n\n* Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Enterprise Mobility Evaluation Program: For enterprise mobility products used to protect sensitive or classified data.\n* ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program: For products used to protect SECRET and TOP SECRET data.\n\nThe Australian Certification Authority within the ACSC also certifies product evaluations conducted by licensed commercial facilities, in accordance with the Common Criteria, as part of the Australian Information Security Evaluation Program (AISEP).\n\nFor an organisation seeking to procure evaluated products, the Common Criteria’s\n[Certified Products List](#29b04eaf-5f57-4ea1-a453-8047826dccf5) contains a list of products that have been evaluated and certified in accordance with the Common Criteria. Alternatively, the ACSC can be contacted for information on both products that are in-evaluation as well as those that have completed evaluation via the ASD Enterprise Mobility Evaluation Program or the ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program.\n\n# Cryptographic evaluations\n\nThe Common Criteria leverages the\n[Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program](#42e7d99d-9709-4355-a54d-98959c552aa1) for the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms used by cryptographic modules within evaluated products. All cryptographic evaluations are performed by Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories that are accredited by the United States’ National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program to International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 17025:2017,\n[General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories](#edd67903-94ef-4edd-9789-73e0141cd77c).\n\n# Protection Profiles\n\nA Protection Profile (PP) is a technology-specific document that defines the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluated product to mitigate specific cyber threats. PPs can be published by a recognised Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) scheme or by the CCRA body itself. PPs published by the CCRA body are referred to as collaborative PPs.\n\nThe ACSC recognises all PPs listed on the Common Criteria website in addition to those listed on the ACSC’s website. Where a PP does not exist, an evaluation based on an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) may be accepted. Such evaluations are capped at EAL2+ as this represents the best balance between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.\n\n# Evaluation documentation\n\nAn organisation choosing to use Common Criteria evaluated products can determine their suitability by reviewing their evaluation documentation. This includes the security target and certification report.\n\nProducts that are undergoing a Common Criteria evaluation will not have published evaluation documentation. However, documentation can be obtained from the ACSC if a product is being evaluated through the AISEP. For a product that is in evaluation through a foreign scheme, the product’s vendor can be contacted directly for further information.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on the\n[ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program](#92da50be-4afa-4be0-9124-bc7a638d9bf4) is available from the ACSC.\n\nFurther information on the\n[AISEP](#57c58870-2ebb-4fce-b995-0c86cb64002f) is available from the ACSC.\n\nFurther information on Common Criteria evaluated products can be found on the Common Criteria’s\n[Certified Products List](#29b04eaf-5f57-4ea1-a453-8047826dccf5).\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the\n[Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28)."

Alternatively, if suitable write-once media is not used, the destination system should have a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured, such as via a read-only device or hardware write-blocker. However, the use of read-only mechanisms is not immune to failure or compromise, therefore, rewritable media should still be sanitised following each data transfer.\n\nIt is important to note that for most non-volatile flash memory media, it will be possible to sanitise and reclassify it following a data transfer in order to allow it to be connected to other systems again.

For example, up to minutes at normal room temperatures and up to hours in extremely cold temperatures. Furthermore, some volatile media can suffer from long-term remanence effects resulting from physical changes due to the continuous storage of static data for extended periods of time. It is for these reasons that under certain circumstances TOP SECRET volatile media retains its classification following sanitisation.\n\nTypical circumstances preventing the reclassification of TOP SECRET volatile media include a static cryptographic key being stored in the same memory location during every boot of a device, or a static image being displayed on a device and stored in volatile media for a period of months."

            "prose" : "Non-volatile magnetic media encompasses non-volatile magnetic hard drives, tape drives and floppy disks. While non-volatile magnetic tape drives and floppy disks can be sanitised by overwriting them at least once (or three times if pre-2001 or under 15 GB) in their entirety with a random pattern followed by a read back for verification, additional considerations apply to non-volatile magnetic hard drives due to their use of a host-protected area, device configuration overlay table and growth defects table.\n\nBoth the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard drives are normally not visible to a computer’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or operating system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of non-volatile magnetic hard drives will leave any data contained in sectors listed in the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset non-volatile magnetic hard drives to their default state, thereby removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of non-volatile magnetic hard drives during subsequent sanitisation processes.\n\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or ‘g-list’. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added to the growth defects table, sanitising the non-volatile magnetic hard drive will not overwrite such data. While these sectors may be considered bad by non-volatile magnetic hard drives, quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability to read or write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command was built into the firmware of post-2001 non-volatile magnetic hard drives and is able to access sectors that have been added to the growth defects table.\n\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives also contain a primary defects table or ‘p-list’. The primary defects table contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes. No data is ever stored in sectors listed in the primary defects table as they are marked as inaccessible before non-volatile magnetic hard drives are used for the first time."

When degaussing magnetic media, care needs to be taken as a degausser of insufficient magnetic field strength will not be effective. In addition, since 2006 perpendicular magnetic media has progressively replaced longitudinal magnetic media. As some older degaussers are only capable of destroying longitudinal magnetic media, care needs to be taken to ensure that a degausser with a suitable magnetic orientation is also used. Furthermore, to ensure that degaussers are being used in the correct manner to effectively destroy magnetic media, product-specific directions provided by degausser manufacturers should be followed. Finally, to provide an additional level of assurance following the use of a degausser, magnetic media should be physically damaged by deforming any internal platters."

Such operating environments may assist an adversary in gaining an initial foothold on networks due to the higher likelihood of poorly configured or maintained workstations and servers. Conversely, a Standard Operating Environment (SOE) is designed to facilitate a standardised and consistent operating environment within an organisation.\n\nWhen SOEs are obtained from third parties, such as service providers, there are additional cyber supply chain risks that should be considered, such as the accidental or deliberate inclusion of malicious code or configurations. To reduce the likelihood of such occurrences, an organisation should endeavour to obtain their SOEs from trusted third parties while also scanning them for malicious code and configurations.\n\nAs operating environments naturally change over time, such as patches or updates are applied, configurations are changed, and applications are added or removed, it is essential that SOEs are reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure that an up-to-date baseline is maintained."

When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm), HTML applications (e.g. .hta), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.\n\nIn implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by an adversary.\n\nFinally, application control event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, application control event logs should be captured and stored centrally."

However, PowerShell can also be a dangerous exploitation tool in the hands of an adversary.\n\nIn order to prevent attacks leveraging security vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 should be disabled or removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between security and functionality.\n\nFinally, PowerShell event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, PowerShell event logs should be captured and stored centrally."

A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.\n\nFinally, Microsoft Office macro event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, Microsoft Office macro event logs should be captured and stored centrally."

This may include:\n\n* something a user knows, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)\n* something a user has, such as a security key, smart card, smartphone or one-time password token\n* something a user is, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.\n\nNote, however, that if a memorised secret is written down, or stored in a document on a system, this becomes something that a user has rather than something a user knows.\n\nPrivileged users, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing an adversary’s ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.\n\nWhen implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something a user has should be used as part of multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of verifier impersonation resistant authentication factors are recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.\n\nFinally, multi-factor authentication event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, multi-factor authentication event logs should be captured and stored centrally."

When an adversary gains access to a list of usernames and hashed credentials from a system they can attempt to recover username and credential pairs by comparing the hashes of known credentials with the hashed credentials they have gained access to. By finding a match an adversary will know the credential associated with a given username.\n\nIn order to reduce this security risk, an organisation should implement multi-factor authentication. Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable for protecting sensitive or classified data, it may not be possible to implement multi-factor authentication on some systems. In such cases, an organisation will need to increase the time on average it takes an adversary to compromise a credential by continuing to increase its length over time. Such increases in length can be balanced against useability through the use of passphrases rather than passwords. In cases where systems do not support passphrases, and as an absolute last resort, the strongest password length and complexity supported by a system will need to be implemented."

            "prose" : "When local administrator accounts and service accounts use common usernames and credentials, it can allow an adversary that compromises credentials on one workstation or server to easily compromise other workstations and servers. As such, it is critical that credentials for local administrator accounts and service accounts are long, unique, unpredictable and managed.\n\nTo provide additional security and credential management functionality for service accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts to Microsoft Windows Server. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service Accounts do not require manual credential management by system administrators, as the operating system automatically ensures that they are long, unique, unpredictable and managed. This ensures that service account credentials are secure, not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular basis. However, in cases where the use of group Managed Service Accounts is not possible, credentials for service accounts should still be unique and unpredictable with a minimum length of 30 characters.\n\nWritten down credentials (e.g. memorised secrets), and dedicated devices that store or generate credentials (e.g. security keys, smart cards and one-time password tokens), when kept together with systems they are used to authenticate to can increase the likelihood of an adversary gaining unauthorised access to systems. For example, when smart cards are left on desks, one-time password tokens are left in laptop bags, security keys are left connected to computers or passphrases are written down and stuck to computer monitors. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.\n\nIf storing credentials on systems, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched. In addition, Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials.\n\nWhen using Microsoft Windows systems, cached credentials are stored in the Security Accounts Manager database and can allow a user to logon to a workstation they have previously logged onto even if the domain is not available. Whilst this functionality may be desirable from an availability perspective, this functionality can be abused by an adversary who can retrieve these cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon."

In doing so, a computing environment could consist of an entire operating system installed in a virtual machine where the isolation mechanism is a hypervisor, such as cloud services providing Infrastructure as a Service, or alternatively, a computing environment could consist of an application which uses the shared kernel of the underlying operating system of the physical server where the isolation mechanism is an application container or application sandbox, such as cloud services providing Platform as a Service. Note, however, the logical separation of data within a single application, such as cloud services providing Software as a Service, is not considered to be the same as multiple computing environments.\n\nAn adversary who has compromised a single computing environment, or who legitimately controls a single computing environment, might exploit a misconfiguration or security vulnerability in the isolation mechanism to compromise other computing environments on the same physical server or compromise the underlying operating system of the physical server.

For example, by prioritising patches or updates for security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services and their operating systems, especially when exploitation code exists or active exploitation is occurring.\n\nIf no patches or updates are available for security vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to security vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.\n\nIf a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, the ACSC will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, the ACSC will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied."

Furthermore, following the verification and resolution of reported security vulnerabilities, it can assist an organisation in notifying their customers of security vulnerabilities that have been discovered in their products and services, and any patches, updates or vendor mitigations that should be applied.\n\nA vulnerability disclosure program should include processes and procedures for receiving, verifying, resolving and reporting security vulnerabilities disclosed by both internal and external parties. In support of this, a vulnerability disclosure policy should be made publicly available that covers:\n\n* the purpose of the vulnerability disclosure program\n* types of security research that are and are not allowed\n* how to report any security vulnerabilities\n* actions, and associated timeframes, upon notification of security vulnerabilities\n* expectations regarding the public disclosure of security vulnerabilities\n* any recognition or reward for finders of security vulnerabilities.\n\nFinally, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) encourages security researchers and other members of the public to responsibly report security vulnerabilities directly to an organisation. However, the ACSC recognises that this is not always practical, initial attempts at communication may be unsuccessful or the person making the report may not wish to do so directly. In such cases, security vulnerabilities can be reported to the ACSC as an independent coordinator."

Implementing opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption can mitigate this security risk while ensuring email servers remain compatible with each other. However, opportunistic TLS encryption is susceptible to downgrade attacks. To mitigate this security risk, Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) allows domain owners to indicate that email transfers should only occur if satisfactory TLS encryption is negotiated beforehand.\n\nImplementing MTA-STS reduces the opportunity for downgrade attacks during email transfers, and provides visibility of when they are attempted. TLS reporting supports the implementation of MTA-STS by providing a mechanism for a domain owner to publish a location where reports can be submitted regarding the success or failure of attempts to initiate encrypted connections when sending emails to a specified domain."

As such, an organisation exclusively using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) should disable IPv6. This will assist in minimising the attack surface of networks and ensure that IPv6 cannot be exploited by an adversary.\n\nTo aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, numerous tunnelling protocols have been developed to allow interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6. Disabling IPv6 tunnelling protocols on networks that do not require such functionality will prevent an adversary from bypassing traditional network defences by encapsulating IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets.\n\nStateless Address Autoconfiguration is a method of stateless Internet Protocol (IP) address configuration in IPv6 networks. Notably, it reduces the ability of an organisation to maintain effective logs of IP address assignments on networks. For this reason, stateless IP addressing should be avoided."

As such, it is important to harden the configuration settings of wireless access points prior to their deployment in networks. In addition, some wireless access points come with default Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs). As default SSIDs are often documented on the internet, it is important to change default SSIDs of wireless access points.\n\nWhen changing default SSIDs, it is important that new SSIDs do not bring undue attention to an organisation’s wireless networks. In doing so, SSIDs of wireless networks should not be readily associated with an organisation, the location of their premises or the functionality of wireless networks.\n\nA method commonly recommended to lower the profile of wireless networks is disabling SSID broadcasting. While this ensures that the existence of wireless networks are not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, SSIDs are still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests. As such, it is easy to determine SSIDs of wireless networks by capturing these requests and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting, an organisation will make it more difficult for users to connect to wireless networks. Furthermore, an adversary could configure a malicious wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as a hidden SSID used by a legitimate wireless network, thereby fooling users or devices into automatically connecting to the adversary’s malicious wireless access point instead. In doing so, the adversary could steal authentication credentials in order to gain access to the legitimate wireless network."

A number of EAP methods supported by both WPA2 and WPA3 are available.\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) is considered one of the most secure EAP methods and is widely supported. It uses a Public Key Infrastructure to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an organisation to have established a Public Key Infrastructure. This involves deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or sourcing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses their wireless networks.

While issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, it comes at a higher cost. However, users are more likely to notice missing smart cards and alert their security team, who are then able to revoke their credentials, which can minimise the time an adversary has access to wireless networks. In addition, to reduce the likelihood of stolen smart cards from being used to gain unauthorised access to wireless networks, multi-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of personal identification numbers on smart cards.

When devices roam away from wireless access points they have authenticated to, they will not need to perform a full re-authentication should they roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate devices to neighbouring wireless access points that devices might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for devices each time they roam between wireless access points is ideal, an organisation can choose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming. If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours)."

Furthermore, an organisation and their cloud service providers should discuss whether dedicated communication links or connections over the internet will be used and whether any secondary communications links will provide sufficient capacity to maintain operational requirements should the primary communication link become unavailable.\n\nFurthermore, capacity monitoring should be performed in order to manage workloads and monitor the health of online services. This can be achieved through continuous real-time monitoring of metrics, such as latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput and availability. In addition, feedback should be provided to cloud service providers when performance does not meet service level agreement targets.

To achieve this goal, an adversary may use a number of methods to deny access to legitimate users of online services. This includes using multiple computers to direct a large volume of unwanted network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume all available network bandwidth, using multiple computers to direct tailored network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume the processing resources of online services, or hijacking online services in an attempt to redirect legitimate users away from those services to other services that the adversary controls.\n\nAlthough an organisation cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks, there are a number of measures they can implement to prepare for and potentially reduce the impact if targeted. This includes engaging with their cloud service providers to identify the denial of service detection technologies that may be available for their use. For example, real-time capacity reporting dashboards that provide out-of-band and real-time alerts based on organisation-defined thresholds can assist with the rapid identification of denial-of-service attacks.\n\nFinally, not all online services offered by an organisation may be business critical. Understanding what online services can be disabled or offered with reduced functionality during denial-of-service attacks can help an organisation reduce or eliminate the impact on essential services. Overall, preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur is by far the best strategy as it is very difficult to respond once they begin and efforts at this stage are unlikely to be effective."

          "prose" : "# Purpose of cryptography\n\nThe purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of data. In doing so, confidentiality protects data by making it unreadable to all but authorised entities, integrity protects data from accidental or deliberate manipulation by entities, authentication ensures that an entity is who they claim to be, and non-repudiation provides proof that an entity performed a particular action.\n\n# Using encryption\n\nEncryption of data at rest can be used to protect sensitive or classified data stored on ICT equipment and media. In addition, encryption of data in transit can be used to protect sensitive or classified data communicated over public network infrastructure. However, when an organisation uses encryption for data at rest, or data in transit, they are not reducing the sensitivity or classification of the data, they are simply reducing the immediate consequences of the data being accessed by an adversary.\n\n# International standards for cryptographic modules\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 19790:2012,\n[Information technology – Security techniques – Security requirements for cryptographic modules](#a07c439d-b2f4-4ee2-b56e-f17000f3722f), and ISO/IEC 24759:2017,\n[Information technology – Security techniques – Test requirements for cryptographic modules](#aaf83df2-02e3-4f9f-bdf5-33fbff42842d), are international standards for the design and validation of hardware and software cryptographic modules.\n\nFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3,\n[Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules](#32c8fa3a-45bb-4f88-baee-73a7696aa2ad) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 180-140,\n[FIPS 140-3 Derived Test Requirements (DTR): CMVP Validation Authority Updates to ISO/IEC 24759](#197db872-c6a9-4b29-9888-1552e908252c) are United States standards based upon ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and ISO/IEC 24759:2017.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cryptographic key management practices can be found in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5,\n[Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 – General](#ffc8a1f6-f4e3-4ff5-a7f9-f41f766274eb).\n\nFurther information on cryptographic key management practices for ASD-approved HACE is available from the ACSC.\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the\n[Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on evaluated products can be found in the evaluated product procurement section of the\n[Guidelines for Evaluated Products](#a699a3aa-828d-479b-b50b-98127bb19437).\n\nFurther information on the evaluation of cryptographic modules, including testing requirements, is available as part of the\n[Cryptographic Module Validation Program](#28cd91d2-e5cb-4896-bcfc-abb32e05e61d) which is jointly operated by NIST and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.\n\nFurther information on the protection of ICT equipment and media can be found in the Attorney-General’s Department’s\n[Protective Security Policy Framework](#92679127-f61d-486a-a93e-df2a26dfb07a),\n[Physical security for entity resources](#6e456a92-f405-4151-88ca-5621aa23519b) policy."

Further information on high assurance cryptographic algorithms can be obtained from the ACSC.\n\n# ASD-Approved Cryptographic Algorithms\n\nThere is no guarantee of an algorithm’s resistance to currently unknown attacks. However, the algorithms listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting. Approval for the use of the algorithms listed in this section is limited to cases where they are implemented in accordance with these guidelines.\n\nThe approved asymmetric/public key algorithms are:\n\n* Diffie-Hellman (DH) for agreeing on encryption session keys\n* Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for digital signatures\n* Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange\n* Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for digital signatures\n* Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) for digital signatures and passing encryption session keys or similar keys.\n\nThe only approved hashing algorithm is Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2).\n\nThe only approved symmetric encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\nWhere there is a range of key sizes for an algorithm, some of the smaller key sizes are not approved as they do not provide an adequate safety margin against possible future attacks. For example, advances in integer factorisation methods could render smaller RSA moduli vulnerable.\n\nThe targets used for the effective security strength of algorithms listed within this section are 112 bits for PROTECTED and below data, 128 bits for SECRET data and 192 bits for TOP SECRET data. However, some key sizes and curves are preferred in order to ensure interoperability with the United States’ Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on the United States’\n[Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite](#e8a28fa5-4ea1-4ef5-a870-4d59e40fab37) is available from the United States’ National Security Agency."

In doing so, gateways take on the highest sensitivity or classification of connected security domains.\n\nThis section describes controls applicable to all types of gateways. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of gateways being deployed and the security domains involved. For example, the Cross Domain Solutions section should be consulted for gateways between different security domains where at least one security domain is classified SECRET or TOP SECRET.\n\nPersonnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of gateways should also refer to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)’s\n[gateway security guidance package](#3df21b72-0559-4bbf-a990-5ee509f70747) of publications.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the\n[Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on the procurement of outsourced services can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the\n[Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on designing, configuring and managing networks can be found in the network design and configuration section of the\n[Guidelines for Networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on privileged access to systems can be found in the access to systems and their resources section of the\n[Guidelines for Personnel Security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2).\n\nFurther information on cyber security awareness training can be found in the cyber security awareness training section of the\n[Guidelines for Personnel Security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2).\n\nFurther information on authenticating users can be found in the authentication hardening section of the\n[Guidelines for System Hardening](#de7525f3-a466-40a5-abdd-3ae24a6d1b44).\n\nFurther information on authenticating ICT equipment can be found in the network design and configuration section of the\n[Guidelines for Networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on\n[RPKI](#7da35efd-7196-4aba-bd79-30c19e8ef48b) and\n[ROA records](#355b47b5-6253-4be5-ba7c-274833d84b75) is available from the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre.\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the\n[Guidelines for System Monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on\n[the purpose of IRAP](#84d3cbab-ab84-4981-a4f7-2bd469c8deaf), and\n[a list of current IRAP assessors](#bdd11ace-cb4e-470a-92ad-556c79b6c14a), is available from the ACSC."

In doing so, it is important that gateways are used not only between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, but also between an organisation’s networks that belong to different security domains and between an organisation’s networks and other organisations’ networks that are connected via means other than public network infrastructure.\n\nWhen implementing gateways between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, an organisation should place any services that external parties require access to within a demilitarised zone. This can mitigate security risks for an organisation when hosting such services in an internet-accessible manner.\n\nFinally, in architecting gateways, it is important that they only allow explicitly authorised data flows. In support of this, gateways should inspect and filter data flows at the transport and above network layers. Furthermore, gateways should be capable of performing ingress traffic filtering to detect and prevent Internet Protocol (IP) source address spoofing."

          "prose" : "# Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions\n\nA Cross Domain Solution (CDS) is a system comprised of security-enforcing functions tailored to mitigate specific security risks associated with accessing or transferring data between different security domains. CDSs may be an integrated appliance or, more commonly, be composed of discrete technologies or sub-systems, with each sub-system consisting of hardware or software components.\n\nThis section describes the controls applicable to CDSs and extends upon the prior gateways section. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of CDSs being deployed.\n\nPersonnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of CDSs should also refer to the ACSC’s\n[Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions](#86847be4-3a06-4d2f-9952-447158593e0d) and\n[Fundamentals of Cross Domain Solutions](#f32020e9-4cb3-486b-bcbb-6fb6719f58a5) publications.\n\n# Types of Cross Domain Solutions\n\nThis section defines two types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs and Access CDSs. These definitions are closely aligned with how CDSs are described and sold by vendors. Note, however, vendors may also offer combined Access and Transfer CDSs.\n\nIn defining the functionality of different types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs facilitate the transfer of data in one direction (unidirectional) or multiple directions (bi-directional) between different security domains. In comparison, Access CDSs provide users with access to multiple security domains from a single device. However, while Access CDSs allow interaction with different security domains, they do not allow users to move data between the different security domains.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on cyber supply chain risk management can be found in the cyber supply chain risk management section of the\n[Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on evaluated products can be found in the evaluated product procurement section of the\n[Guidelines for Evaluated Products](#a699a3aa-828d-479b-b50b-98127bb19437).\n\nFurther information on designing, configuring and managing networks can be found in the network design and configuration section of the\n[Guidelines for Networking](#f145ff5b-d396-4248-8f48-621349d6f0ed).\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the\n[Guidelines for System Monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on cyber security awareness training can be found in the cyber security awareness training section of the\n[Guidelines for Personnel Security](#7d16ae67-87a7-4861-b939-e13ec279b5a2)."
