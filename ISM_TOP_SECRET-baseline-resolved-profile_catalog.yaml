          # Purpose of the cyber security principles

          The purpose of the cyber security principles is to provide strategic guidance on how an organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security principles are grouped into four key activities: govern, protect, detect and respond.

          * Govern: Identifying and managing security risks.
          * Protect: Implementing controls to reduce security risks.
          * Detect: Detecting and understanding cyber security events to identify cyber security incidents.
          * Respond: Responding to and recovering from cyber security incidents.

          # Maturity modelling

          When implementing the cyber security principles, an organisation can use the following maturity model to assess the implementation of individual principles, groups of principles or the cyber security principles as a whole. The five levels in the maturity model are:

          * Incomplete: The cyber security principles are partially implemented or not implemented.
          * Initial: The cyber security principles are implemented, but in a poor or ad hoc manner.
          * Developing: The cyber security principles are sufficiently implemented, but on a project-by-project basis.
          * Managing: The cyber security principles are established as standard business practices and robustly implemented throughout the organisation.
          * Optimising: A deliberate focus on optimisation and continual improvement exists for the implementation of the cyber security principles throughout the organisation.

          # Required skills and experience

          The role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) requires a combination of technical and soft skills, such as business acumen, leadership, communications and relationship building. Additionally, a CISO must adopt a continuous approach to learning and up-skilling in order to maintain pace with the cyber threat landscape and new technologies. It is expected that a CISO show innovation and imagination in conceiving and delivering cyber security strategies for their organisation.

            The CISO is responsible for reporting cyber security matters to their organisation’s senior executive or Board. Reporting should cover:

            * the organisation’s security risk profile
            * the status of key systems and any outstanding security risks
            * any planned cyber security uplift activities
            * any recent cyber security incidents
            * expected returns on cyber security investments.

            Reporting on cyber security matters should be structured by business functions, regions or legal entities and support a consolidated view of an organisation’s security risks.

            It is important that the CISO is able to translate security risks into operational risks for their organisation, including financial and legal risks, in order to enable more holistic conversations about their organisation’s risks.

          # Cyber security events

          A cyber security event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be relevant to security.

          # Cyber security incidents

          A cyber security incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events, that have a significant probability of compromising business operations.

          # Cyber resilience

          Cyber resilience is the ability to adapt to disruptions caused by cyber security incidents while maintaining continuous business operations. This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.

          # Detecting cyber security incidents

          One of the core elements of detecting and investigating cyber security incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources. Fortunately, many data sources can be extracted from existing systems without requiring specialised capabilities.

          The following are some of the data sources that an organisation can use for detecting and investigating cyber security incidents:

          * Domain Name System event logs: Can assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domains or Internet Protocol addresses which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          * Email server event logs: Can assist in identifying users targeted with spear-phishing emails. Can also assist in identifying the initial vector of a compromise.
          * Gateway event logs: Can assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          * Operating system and application event logs: Can assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity which can indicate an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
          * Remote access event logs: Can assist in identifying unusual source addresses, times of access and logon/logoff times associated with malicious activity.
          * Web proxy event logs: Can assist in identifying Hypertext Transfer Protocol-based vectors and malicious network traffic.

          # Further information

          Further information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the
          [Guidelines for System Monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).

          Further information on incident response plans can be found in the system-specific security documentation section of the
          [Guidelines for Security Documentation](#578d0434-6b3f-46f3-aad8-c7ac75c2ebcc).

          Further information on establishing and operating a trusted insider program can be found in the Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute’s
          [Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats](#cad720b4-e47a-437d-b272-6958e738131d) publication.

            Establishing an incident management policy can increase the likelihood of successfully planning for, detecting and responding to malicious activity on networks and hosts, such as cyber security events and cyber security incidents. In doing so, an incident management policy will likely cover the following:

            * responsibilities for planning for, detecting and responding to cyber security incidents
            * resources assigned to cyber security incident planning, detection and response activities
            * guidelines for triaging and responding to cyber security events and cyber security incidents.

            Furthermore, as part of maintaining the incident management policy, it is important that it is, along with its associated incident response plan, exercised at least annually to ensure it remains fit for purpose.

            As a trusted insider's system access and knowledge of business processes often makes them harder to detect, establishing a trusted insider program can assist an organisation to detect and respond to trusted insider threats before they occur, or limit damage if they do occur. In doing so, an organisation will likely obtain the most benefit by logging and analysing the following user activities:

            * excessive copying or modification of files
            * unauthorised or excessive use of removable media
            * connecting devices capable of data storage to systems
            * unusual system usage outside of normal business hours
            * excessive data access or printing compared to their peers
            * data transfers to unauthorised cloud services or webmail
            * use of unauthorised Virtual Private Networks, file transfer applications or anonymity networks.

            When an intrusion is detected on a system, an organisation may wish to allow the intrusion to continue for a short period of time in order to fully understand the extent of the compromise and to assist with planning intrusion remediation activities. However, an organisation allowing an intrusion to continue in order to collect data or evidence should first establish with their legal advisors whether such activities would be breaching the
            [Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979](#e4c07309-9ca8-40b7-9571-4f6c032180a1).

            To increase the likelihood of intrusion remediation activities successfully removing an adversary from their system, an organisation can take preventative measures to ensure the adversary has limited forewarning and awareness of planned intrusion remediation activities. Specifically, using an alternative system to plan and coordinate intrusion remediation activities will prevent alerting the adversary if they have already compromised email, messaging or collaboration services. In addition, conducting intrusion remediation activities in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage will prevent forewarning the adversary, thereby depriving them of sufficient time to establish alternative access points or persistence methods on the system.

            Following intrusion remediation activities, an organisation should determine whether the adversary has been successfully removed from the system, including whether or not they have since reacquired access. This can be achieved, in part, by capturing and analysing network traffic for at least seven days following remediation activities.

            The ACSC uses the cyber security incident reports it receives as the basis for providing assistance to organisations. Cyber security incident reports are also used by the ACSC to identify trends and maintain an accurate threat environment picture. The ACSC utilises this understanding to assist in the development of new and updated cyber security advice, capabilities, and techniques to better prevent and respond to evolving cyber threats. An organisation is recommended to internally coordinate their reporting of cyber security incidents to the ACSC.

            The types of cyber security incidents that should be reported to the ACSC include:

            * suspicious activities, such as privileged account lockouts and unusual remote access activities
            * compromise of sensitive or classified data
            * unauthorised access or attempts to access a system

            Cyber supply chain risk management activities should be conducted during the earliest possible stage of procurement of applications, ICT equipment and services. In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, ICT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customers’ knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries’ laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign government’s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.

            In managing cyber supply chain risks, it is important that an organisation preferences suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products and services – including throughout distribution channels. In addition, suppliers should have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains. Also, in some cases, a shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers and their customers can be highly beneficial.

            In purchasing applications, ICT equipment and services, an organisation should use trusted suppliers that they have previously vetted as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessments and subsequently recorded on their approved supplier list.

            Furthermore, in order to support system availability, an organisation should aim to identify multiple potential suppliers for critical applications, ICT equipment and services. This coupled with keeping sufficient spares of critical ICT equipment in reserve, can assist in mitigating the impact of cyber supply chain disruptions.

            As part of the delivery of applications, ICT equipment and services, measures should be implemented to protect their integrity, noting that such measures will differ depending on whether delivery relates to digital or physical distribution channels. For example, applications may benefit from delivery via encrypted communication channels while ICT equipment may benefit from tracking and tamper-evident packaging. In doing so, such measures are only beneficial if they are assessed as part of acceptance of products and services. In all cases, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the integrity of their products and services.

            While ensuring the integrity of applications, ICT equipment and services is important, so is ensuring their authenticity. For example, a counterfeit product or service securely delivered is still a counterfeit product or service that may not operate as intended or pose a risk to the security of a system. To assist in identifying counterfeit products and services, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the authenticity of their products and services.

            Obligations for protecting data are no different when using a managed service or cloud service than when using an in-house service. As such, contractual arrangements between service providers and their customers should address how security risks will be managed. However, in some cases an organisation may require managed services or cloud services to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by a service provider. In such cases, contractual arrangements should include appropriate timeframes for the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.

            In addition, although data ownership resides with service providers’ customers, this can become less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, an organisation can document the types of data and its ownership through contractual arrangements.

            Furthermore, an organisation may make the decision to move from their current service provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may involve changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service providers can assist their customers by ensuring data is as portable as possible and that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary formats may make it more difficult for an organisation to perform backup, service migration or service decommissioning activities.

            Finally, to ensure that an organisation is given sufficient time to download their data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering a particular service, a one month notification period should be documented in contractual arrangements.

          # System-specific security documentation

          System-specific security documentation, such as a system security plan, incident response plan, continuous monitoring plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones, supports the accurate and consistent application of policies, processes and procedures for systems. As such, it is important that they are developed by personnel with a good understanding of business requirements, technologies being used and cyber security matters.

          System-specific security documentation may be presented in a number of formats, including in wikis or other forms of document repositories. Furthermore, depending on the documentation framework used, details common to multiple systems could be consolidated into higher level security documentation.

            A continuous monitoring plan can assist an organisation in proactively identifying, prioritising and responding to security vulnerabilities. Measures to monitor and manage security vulnerabilities in systems can also provide an organisation with a wealth of valuable information about their exposure to cyber threats, as well as assisting them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking continuous monitoring activities is important as cyber threats and the effectiveness of controls will change over time.

            Three types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability assessments, vulnerability scans and penetration tests. A vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review of a system’s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment while a vulnerability scan involves using software tools to conduct automated checks for known security vulnerabilities. In each case, the goal is to identify as many security vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however is designed to exercise real-world scenarios in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data. Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel can be internal to an organisation or from a third party. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken in an objective manner.

Notably, physical security certification authorities dealing with deployable platforms may have specific requirements that supersede the controls in these guidelines. This may include perimeter controls, building standards and manning levels. As such, an organisation implementing deployable platforms should contact their physical security certification authority to seek additional guidance.

            Unprotected network devices in public areas could lead to accidental or deliberate physical damage resulting in an interruption of services. Alternatively, unauthorised access to network devices may allow an adversary to reset them to factory default settings, thereby removing any controls, or connect directly to them in order to bypass network access controls. Even if access to network devices is not gained by resetting them to factory default settings, it is highly likely that it will cause an interruption of services.

            Physical access to network devices can be restricted through the implementation of physical security, such as using enclosures that prevent access to their console ports and factory reset buttons, mounting them on ceilings or behind walls, or securing them in security containers.

            Radio Frequency (RF) devices, such as mobile devices, wireless keyboards and Bluetooth devices, as well as infrared (IR) devices, can pose a security risk to an organisation, especially when they are capable of recording or transmitting audio or data. In SECRET and TOP SECRET areas, it is important that an organisation understands the security risks associated with the introduction of RF and IR devices and maintain a register of those that have been authorised for use in such environments.

            In deciding which RF or IR devices to authorise to be brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas, an organisation should consider any mitigating measures already in place, such as whether IR communications would be prevented from travelling outside secured spaces, whether systems of different sensitives or classifications are used in the same spaces, and if any temporary or permanent method of blocking RF or IR transmissions has been applied to the facility.

            ICT equipment and media needs to be secured when not in use. This can be achieved by implementing one of the following approaches:

            * securing ICT equipment and media in an appropriate security container or secure room
            * using ICT equipment without hard drives and sanitising memory at shut down
            * encrypting hard drives of ICT equipment and sanitising memory at shut down
            * sanitising memory of ICT equipment at shut down and removing and securing any hard drives.

            If none of the above approaches are feasible, an organisation may wish to minimise the potential impact of not securing ICT equipment when not in use. This can be achieved by preventing sensitive or classified data from being stored on hard drives, storing user profiles and documents on network shares, removing temporary user data at logoff, scrubbing virtual memory at shut down, and sanitising memory at shut down. It should be noted though that there is no guarantee that such measures will always work effectively or will not be bypassed due to unexpected circumstances, such as the loss of power. Therefore, hard drives in such cases will retain their sensitivity or classification for the purposes of reuse, reclassification, declassification, sanitisation, destruction and disposal.

            Business email compromise, a form of financial fraud, is when an adversary attempts to scam an organisation out of money or assets with the assistance of a compromised email account. An adversary will typically attempt to achieve this via invoice fraud, employee impersonation or company impersonation.

            With invoice fraud, an adversary will compromise a vendor’s email account and through it have access to legitimate invoices. The adversary will then edit contact and bank details on invoices and send them to customers with the compromised email account. Customers will then pay the invoices, thinking that they are paying the vendor, but instead be sending money to the adversary’s bank account.

            With employee impersonation, an adversary will compromise an organisation’s email account and impersonate an employee via email. This is then used to commit financial fraud in a number of ways. One common method is to impersonate a person in a position of authority, such as a Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, and have a false invoice raised. Another method is to request a change to an employee’s banking details. The funds from the false invoice or the employee's salary is then sent to the adversary’s bank account.

            With company impersonation, an adversary registers a domain with a name similar to another organisation. The adversary then impersonates that organisation in an email to a vendor and requests a quote for a quantity of expensive assets, such as laptops, and subsequently negotiates for the assets to be delivered to them prior to payment. The assets are then delivered to a location specified by the adversary, with the invoice being sent to the legitimate organisation who never ordered or received the assets.

            To mitigate business email compromise, personnel should be educated to look for the following warning signs:

            * an unexpected request for a change of banking details
            * an urgent payment request, or threats of serious consequences if payment is not made
            * unexpected payment requests from a person in a position of authority, particularly if payment requests are unusual from this person
            * an email received from a suspicious email address, such as an email address not matching an organisation’s name.

            In dealing with such situations, personnel should have clear guidance to verify bank account details; think critically before actioning unusual payment requests; and have a process to report threatening demands for immediate action, pressure for secrecy, or requests to circumvent normal business processes and procedures.

            Privileged accounts are considered to be those which can alter or circumvent a system’s controls. This can also apply to users who have only limited privileges, such as software developers, but can still bypass controls. A privileged account often has the ability to modify system configurations, account privileges, event logs and security configurations for applications.

            Privileged users, and in some cases privileged service accounts, are often targeted by an adversary as they can potentially give full access to systems. As such, ensuring that privileged accounts do not have the ability to access the internet, email and web services minimises opportunities for these accounts to be compromised.

            Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that privileged access event logs and privileged account and group change event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

            It is important that an organisation does not lose access to their systems. As such, an organisation should always have a method for gaining access during emergencies. Typically, emergencies would occur when access to systems cannot be gained via normal authentication processes, such as due to misconfigurations of authentication services, misconfigurations of security settings or due to a cyber security incident. In these situations, a break glass account (also known as an emergency access account) can be used to gain access. As break glass accounts generally have the highest level of privileges available for systems, extreme care should be taken to both protect them and to monitor for any signs of compromise or abuse.

            When break glass accounts are used, any administrative activities performed will not be directly attributable to an individual, and systems may not generate event logs. As such, additional controls need to be implemented in order to maintain the system’s integrity. In doing so, an organisation should ensure that any administrative activities performed using a break glass account are identified and documented in support of change management processes and procedures. This includes documenting the individual using the break glass account, the reason for using the break glass account and any administrative activities performed using the break glass account.

            As the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows the account’s credentials, credentials will need to be changed and tested by custodians after any authorised access by another party. Modern password managers that support automated credential changes and testing can assist in reducing the administrative overhead of such activities.

            Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that break glass event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

          # Applicability

          This section is only applicable to facilities located within Australia. In addition, this section only applies to new cabling infrastructure installations or upgrades.

          # Shared facilities

          In addition to common controls, this section provides additional controls for shared facilities, such as a single floor, or part of a floor, within a multi-tenanted building.

          # Cables and structured cabling systems

          For the purposes of this section, a cable is defined as any fibre optic or copper material housed within a protective sheath for the purposes of transmitting data or control signals from one point in a facility to another. Each cable will form part of a structured cabling system and will need to comply with the Australian Standards associated with that system. In addition to network communications and data systems, some common building management structured cabling systems found within facilities are:

          * fire control and sensor systems
          * security control and surveillance systems
          * lighting control systems
          * access control systems
          * voice and emergency telephony systems
          * emergency control alert systems.

          # Cable sheaths and conduits

          A cable’s protective sheath is not considered to be a conduit.

          # Cable connector types

          The same cable connector types can be used for all systems within a facility regardless of their sensitivity or classification.

          # Further information

          [Australian cabling standards and regulations](#7000d51a-6cca-40a0-95d9-f1f15048ea68) can be obtained from the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

            As there is a potential for unintended disclosure of information when using telephone systems, it is important that personnel are made aware of the sensitivity or classification of conversations that they can be used for. In addition, personnel should also be made aware of the security risks associated with the use of non-secure telephone systems in sensitive or classified areas.

            When using cryptographic equipment to enable different levels of conversation for different kinds of connections, providing a visual indication to personnel as to the sensitivity or classification of information that can be discussed over the telephone system can assist in reducing the likelihood of unintended disclosure of information.

            Allowing privately-owned mobile devices to access an organisation’s systems or data can increase liability risk. As such, an organisation should seek legal advice to ascertain whether this scenario affects compliance with relevant legislation, such as the
            [Privacy Act 1988](#6fac5a84-b86e-405f-b2b3-8c13ecee4a02) and the
            [Archives Act 1983](#e0d3b5ea-6a5a-400c-8daa-8a8059816a06), and also consider whether the increased liability risks are acceptable to the organisation.

            If an organisation chooses to allow personnel to use a privately-owned mobile device to access their organisation’s systems or data, they should ensure that it does not present an unacceptable security risk. This can be achieved by encouraging the use of an ASD-approved platform, with a security configuration in accordance with Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) guidance, along with enforced separation of work and personal data.

            To mitigate security risks associated with pairing mobile devices with other Bluetooth devices, Bluetooth version 4.1 introduced the Secure Connections functionality for Bluetooth Classic, while Bluetooth version 4.2 introduced the Secure Connections functionality for Bluetooth Low Energy. This functionality uses keys generated using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography, thereby offering greater security compared to previous key exchange protocols. However, personnel should still consider the location and manner in which they pair OFFICIAL and PROTECTED mobile devices with other Bluetooth devices, such as by avoiding pairing devices in public locations, and remove all Bluetooth pairings when there is no longer a requirement for their use.

            Note, however, the Bluetooth protocol provides inadequate protection for the communication of SECRET and TOP SECRET data. As such, Bluetooth functionality is not suitable for use with SECRET and TOP SECRET mobile devices.

            When connecting mobile devices to the internet, best practice involves establishing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to an organisation’s internet gateway rather than a direct connection to the internet. In doing so, mobile devices will be protected by additional security functionality, such as web content filtering, provided by an organisation’s internet gateway.

            A split tunnel VPN can allow access into an organisation’s network from other networks, such as the internet. If split tunnelling is not disabled there is an increased security risk that the VPN connection will be susceptible to intrusions from other networks. An organisation can refer to the relevant ACSC security configuration guidance for mobile devices on how to mitigate this security risk.

In particular, personnel should take care to ensure that sensitive or classified data is not observed by other parties in public areas, such as on public transport, in transit lounges and at coffee shops. In some cases, privacy filters can be applied to the screen of a mobile device to prevent onlookers from reading content off its screen.

            In addition, personnel should maintain awareness of the environments from which they conduct sensitive or classified phone calls and the potential for their conversations to be overheard.

          # Evaluated products

          An evaluated product provides a level of assurance in its security functionality that an unevaluated product does not. To assist in providing this assurance, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) performs product evaluations through the following programs:

          * Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Enterprise Mobility Evaluation Program: For enterprise mobility products used to protect sensitive or classified data.
          * ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program: For products used to protect SECRET and TOP SECRET data.

          The Australian Certification Authority within the ACSC also certifies product evaluations conducted by licensed commercial facilities, in accordance with the Common Criteria, as part of the Australian Information Security Evaluation Program (AISEP).

          For an organisation seeking to procure evaluated products, the Common Criteria’s
          [Certified Products List](#29b04eaf-5f57-4ea1-a453-8047826dccf5) contains a list of products that have been evaluated and certified in accordance with the Common Criteria. Alternatively, the ACSC can be contacted for information on both products that are in-evaluation as well as those that have completed evaluation via the ASD Enterprise Mobility Evaluation Program or the ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program.

          # Cryptographic evaluations

          The Common Criteria leverages the
          [Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program](#42e7d99d-9709-4355-a54d-98959c552aa1) for the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms used by cryptographic modules within evaluated products. All cryptographic evaluations are performed by Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories that are accredited by the United States’ National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program to International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 17025:2017,
          [General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories](#edd67903-94ef-4edd-9789-73e0141cd77c).

          # Protection Profiles

          A Protection Profile (PP) is a technology-specific document that defines the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluated product to mitigate specific cyber threats. PPs can be published by a recognised Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) scheme or by the CCRA body itself. PPs published by the CCRA body are referred to as collaborative PPs.

          The ACSC recognises all PPs listed on the Common Criteria website in addition to those listed on the ACSC’s website. Where a PP does not exist, an evaluation based on an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) may be accepted. Such evaluations are capped at EAL2+ as this represents the best balance between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.

          # Evaluation documentation

          An organisation choosing to use Common Criteria evaluated products can determine their suitability by reviewing their evaluation documentation. This includes the security target and certification report.

          Products that are undergoing a Common Criteria evaluation will not have published evaluation documentation. However, documentation can be obtained from the ACSC if a product is being evaluated through the AISEP. For a product that is in evaluation through a foreign scheme, the product’s vendor can be contacted directly for further information.

          # Further information

          Further information on the
          [ASD High Assurance Evaluation Program](#92da50be-4afa-4be0-9124-bc7a638d9bf4) is available from the ACSC.

            It is important that an organisation ensures that products they purchase are the actual products that are delivered. In the case of evaluated products, if the product delivered differs from an evaluated version then the assurance gained from the evaluation may not necessarily apply.

            Packaging and delivery practices can vary greatly from product to product. For most evaluated products, standard commercial packaging and delivery practices are likely to be sufficient. However, in some cases more secure packaging and delivery practices, including tamper-evident seals and secure transportation, may be required. In the case of the digital delivery of evaluated products, vendor-supplied checksums can often be used to ensure the integrity of software that was delivered.

          # Evaluated configuration

          An evaluated product is considered to be operating in an evaluated configuration if:

          * functionality that it uses was in the scope of the evaluation and it is implemented in the specified manner
          * only product updates that have been assessed through maintenance and re-evaluation activities (known as assurance continuity) have been applied
          * the environment complies with assumptions or organisational security policies stated in the evaluation documentation.

          # Unevaluated configuration

          An evaluated product is considered to be operating in an unevaluated configuration when it does not meet the requirements of the evaluated configuration and guidance provided in its certification report.

          # Patching evaluated products

          In the majority of cases, the latest patched version of an evaluated product will be more secure than an older unpatched version. While the application of patches will not normally place an evaluated product into an unevaluated configuration, some vendors may include new functionality which has not been evaluated with their patches. In such cases, an organisation should use their judgement to determine whether this deviation from the evaluated configuration constitutes additional security risk or not.

          # Further information

          Further information on patching or updating ICT equipment can be found in the system patching section of the
          [Guidelines for System Management](#c6ca6620-ccd5-4c5d-b97c-9d92f1162948).

            Applying protective markings to ICT equipment assists to reduce the likelihood that a user will accidentally input data into it that it is not approved for processing, storing or communicating.

            While text-based protective markings are typically used for labelling ICT equipment, there may be circumstances where colour-based protective markings or other marking schemes need to be used instead. In such cases, the marking scheme will need to be documented and personnel will need to be trained in its use.

            Undertaking unauthorised maintenance or repairs to ICT equipment could impact its integrity. As such, using appropriately cleared technicians to maintain and repair ICT equipment on site is considered the most secure approach. This ensures that if data is disclosed during the course of maintenance or repairs, the technicians are aware of the requirements to protect such data.

            An organisation choosing to use uncleared technicians to maintain or repair ICT equipment should be aware of the requirement for cleared personnel to escort uncleared technicians during maintenance or repair activities.

            When sanitising ICT equipment, any media within the ICT equipment should be removed or sanitised. Once any media has been removed or sanitised, ICT equipment can be considered sanitised. However, if media cannot be removed or sanitised, the ICT equipment should be destroyed as per media destruction requirements.

            Media typically found in ICT equipment includes:

            * electrostatic memory devices, such as laser printer cartridges used in multifunction devices (MFDs)
            * non-volatile magnetic memory, such as hard disks
            * non-volatile semiconductor memory, such as flash cards and solid state drives
            * volatile memory, such as random-access memory sticks.

            When sanitising printers and MFDs, the printer cartridge or MFD print drum should be sanitised in addition to the removal or sanitisation of any media. This can be achieved by printing random text with no blank areas on each colour printer cartridge or MFD print drum. In addition, image transfer rollers and platens can become imprinted with text and images over time and should be destroyed if any text or images have been retained. Finally, any paper jammed in the paper path should be removed.

            When printer cartridges and MFD print drums cannot be sanitised due to a hardware failure, or when they are empty, there is no other option available but to destroy them. Printer ribbons cannot be sanitised and should be destroyed.

            All types of televisions and computer monitors are capable of retaining data if mitigating measures are not taken during their lifetime. Cathode Ray Tube monitors and plasma screens can be affected by burn-in while Liquid Crystal Display and Organic Light Emitting Diode screens can be affected by image persistence.

            Televisions and computer monitors can be visually inspected by turning up the brightness and contrast to their maximum level to determine if any data has been burnt into or persists on the screen. If burn-in or image persistence is removed by this activity, televisions and computer monitors can be considered sanitised. However, if burn-in or persistence is not removed through these measures, televisions and computer monitors cannot be sanitised and should be destroyed.

            If televisions or computer monitors cannot be powered on, such as due to a faulty power supply, they cannot be sanitised and should be destroyed.

            An organisation transferring data between systems belonging to different security domains is strongly encouraged to use write-once media. When done properly, such as using non-rewritable compact discs that have been finalised, this will ensure that data from the destination system cannot be accidently transferred, or maliciously exfiltrated, onto the media used for the data transfer and then onto another system, such as the original source system. Alternatively, if suitable write-once media is not used, the destination system should have a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured, such as via a read-only device or hardware write-blocker. However, the use of read-only mechanisms is not immune to failure or compromise, therefore, rewritable media should still be sanitised following each data transfer.

            It is important to note that for most non-volatile flash memory media, it will be possible to sanitise and reclassify it following a data transfer in order to allow it to be connected to other systems again. This is not possible for SECRET and TOP SECRET non-volatile flash memory media as it cannot be reclassified following sanitisation.

            Research suggests that short-term remanence effects are likely in volatile media. For example, up to minutes at normal room temperatures and up to hours in extremely cold temperatures. Furthermore, some volatile media can suffer from long-term remanence effects resulting from physical changes due to the continuous storage of static data for extended periods of time. It is for these reasons that under certain circumstances TOP SECRET volatile media retains its classification following sanitisation.

            Typical circumstances preventing the reclassification of TOP SECRET volatile media include a static cryptographic key being stored in the same memory location during every boot of a device, or a static image being displayed on a device and stored in volatile media for a period of months.

            Non-volatile magnetic media encompasses non-volatile magnetic hard drives, tape drives and floppy disks. While non-volatile magnetic tape drives and floppy disks can be sanitised by overwriting them at least once (or three times if pre-2001 or under 15 GB) in their entirety with a random pattern followed by a read back for verification, additional considerations apply to non-volatile magnetic hard drives due to their use of a host-protected area, device configuration overlay table and growth defects table.

            Both the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard drives are normally not visible to a computer’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or operating system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of non-volatile magnetic hard drives will leave any data contained in sectors listed in the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset non-volatile magnetic hard drives to their default state, thereby removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of non-volatile magnetic hard drives during subsequent sanitisation processes.

            Modern non-volatile magnetic hard drives automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or ‘g-list’. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added to the growth defects table, sanitising the non-volatile magnetic hard drive will not overwrite such data. While these sectors may be considered bad by non-volatile magnetic hard drives, quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability to read or write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command was built into the firmware of post-2001 non-volatile magnetic hard drives and is able to access sectors that have been added to the growth defects table.

            Modern non-volatile magnetic hard drives also contain a primary defects table or ‘p-list’. The primary defects table contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes. No data is ever stored in sectors listed in the primary defects table as they are marked as inaccessible before non-volatile magnetic hard drives are used for the first time.

When degaussing magnetic media, care needs to be taken as a degausser of insufficient magnetic field strength will not be effective. In addition, since 2006 perpendicular magnetic media has progressively replaced longitudinal magnetic media. As some older degaussers are only capable of destroying longitudinal magnetic media, care needs to be taken to ensure that a degausser with a suitable magnetic orientation is also used. Furthermore, to ensure that degaussers are being used in the correct manner to effectively destroy magnetic media, product-specific directions provided by degausser manufacturers should be followed. Finally, to provide an additional level of assurance following the use of a degausser, magnetic media should be physically damaged by deforming any internal platters."

            Allowing users to setup, configure and maintain their own workstations and servers can result in an inconsistent operating environment. Such operating environments may assist an adversary in gaining an initial foothold on networks due to the higher likelihood of poorly configured or maintained workstations and servers. Conversely, a Standard Operating Environment (SOE) is designed to facilitate a standardised and consistent operating environment within an organisation.

            When SOEs are obtained from third parties, such as service providers, there are additional cyber supply chain risks that should be considered, such as the accidental or deliberate inclusion of malicious code or configurations. To reduce the likelihood of such occurrences, an organisation should endeavour to obtain their SOEs from trusted third parties while also scanning them for malicious code and configurations.

            As operating environments naturally change over time, such as patches or updates are applied, configurations are changed, and applications are added or removed, it is essential that SOEs are reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure that an up-to-date baseline is maintained.

            Application control can be an effective way to not only prevent malicious code from executing on workstations and servers, but also to ensure only approved applications can execute. When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm), HTML applications (e.g. .hta), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.

            In implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by an adversary.

            Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that application control event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

            PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft and, due to its ubiquity and ease with which it can be used to fully control operating systems, is an important part of system administrator toolkits. However, PowerShell can also be a dangerous exploitation tool in the hands of an adversary.

            In order to prevent attacks leveraging security vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 should be disabled or removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between security and functionality.

            Finally, logging and transcription functionality available in PowerShell can provide invaluable information for incident responders. As such, it is important that PowerShell event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

This approach is only effective when malicious code has already been profiled and signatures are available from security vendors. Unfortunately, an adversary can easily create variants of known malicious code in order to bypass traditional signature-based detection. A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) can use behaviour-based detection to assist in identifying and blocking anomalous behaviour as well as detecting malicious code that has yet to be identified by security vendors. As such, it is important that a HIPS is implemented on workstations, critical servers and high-value servers."

Many forms of malicious code are designed specifically to take advantage of this by using common protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or Domain Name System. Software firewalls are more effective than traditional network firewalls as they can control which applications and services can communicate to and from workstations and servers. As such, a software firewall should be implemented on workstations and servers to restrict inbound and outbound network connections to an organisation-approved set of applications and services."

            Device access control software can be used to prevent removable media and mobile devices from being connected to workstations and servers via external communication interfaces. This can assist in preventing the introduction of malicious code or the exfiltration of data by an adversary.

            In addition, an adversary can connect to locked workstations and servers via external communication interfaces that allow Direct Memory Access (DMA). In doing so, the adversary can gain access to encryption keys in memory or write malicious code to memory. The best defence against this security risk is to disable access to external communication interfaces that allow DMA, such as FireWire, ExpressCard and Thunderbolt.

            Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code, known as a macro, written in the Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.

            Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that Microsoft Office macro event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

            Multi-factor authentication uses two or more authentication factors. This may include:

            * something a user knows, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)
            * something a user has, such as a security key, smart card, smartphone or physical one-time password token
            * something a user is, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.

            Note, however, that if a memorised secret is written down, or stored in a document on a system, this becomes something that a user has rather than something a user knows.

            Privileged users, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing an adversary’s ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.

            When implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something a user has should be used as part of multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of verifier impersonation resistant authentication factors are recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.

            Finally, to assist with incident response activities, it is important that multi-factor authentication event logs are centrally stored and protected from unauthorised modification and deletion, monitored for signs of compromise, and actioned when cyber security events are detected.

            A significant threat to the compromise of accounts is credential cracking tools. When an adversary gains access to a list of usernames and hashed credentials from a system they can attempt to recover username and credential pairs by comparing the hashes of known credentials with the hashed credentials they have gained access to. By finding a match an adversary will know the credential associated with a given username.

            In order to reduce this security risk, an organisation should implement multi-factor authentication. Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable for protecting sensitive or classified data, it may not be possible to implement multi-factor authentication on some systems. In such cases, an organisation will need to increase the time on average it takes an adversary to compromise a credential by continuing to increase its length over time. Such increases in length can be balanced against useability through the use of passphrases rather than passwords. In cases where systems do not support passphrases, and as an absolute last resort, the strongest password length and complexity supported by a system will need to be implemented.

Implementing multi-factor authentication is also an effective way of reducing the likelihood of successful credential spraying attacks."

            When local administrator accounts use common usernames and credentials, it can allow an adversary that compromises credentials on one workstation or server to easily compromise other workstations and servers. As such, it is critical that credentials for local administrator accounts and service accounts are unique, unpredictable and managed.

            Storing physical credentials with a system, such as security keys, smart cards, one-time password tokens and written down memorised secrets, increases the likelihood of an adversary gaining access to the system. For example, when passphrases are written down and stuck to a computer monitor, smart cards are left on desks or security keys are left in laptop bags. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.

            If storing credentials on a system, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched. In addition, Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials.

            When using Microsoft Windows systems, cached credentials are stored in the Security Accounts Manager database and can allow a user to logon to a workstation they have previously logged onto even if the domain is not available. Whilst this functionality may be desirable from an availability perspective, this functionality can be abused by an adversary who can retrieve these cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.

          # Containerisation

          Containers allow for versatile deployment of systems and, in doing so, should be treated the same as any other system. However, controls in a containerised environment may take a different form when compared to other types of systems. For example, patching the operating system of a workstation may be performed differently to ensuring that a patched image is used for a container, however, the principle is the same. In general, the same security risks that apply to non-containerised systems will likely apply to containerised systems.

            Physical servers often use a software-based isolation mechanism to share their hardware among multiple computing environments. In doing so, a computing environment could consist of an entire operating system installed in a virtual machine where the isolation mechanism is a hypervisor, such as cloud services providing Infrastructure as a Service, or alternatively, a computing environment could consist of an application which uses the shared kernel of the underlying operating system of the physical server where the isolation mechanism is an application container or application sandbox, such as cloud services providing Platform as a Service. Note, however, the logical separation of data within a single application, such as cloud services providing Software as a Service, is not considered to be the same as multiple computing environments.

            An adversary who has compromised a single computing environment, or who legitimately controls a single computing environment, might exploit a misconfiguration or security vulnerability in the isolation mechanism to compromise other computing environments on the same physical server or compromise the underlying operating system of the physical server. As such, it is important that additional controls are implemented when a software-based isolation mechanism is used to share a physical server’s hardware.

          # System administration of cloud services

          System administration of cloud services brings unique challenges when compared to system administration of on-premises assets. Notably, responsibility for system administration of cloud services is often shared between service providers and their customers. As the system administration processes and procedures implemented by service providers are often opaque to their customers, customers should consider a service provider’s control plane to operate within a different security domain.

            * configuring applications, operating systems, network devices or other ICT equipment
            * applying patches, updates or vendor mitigations to applications, drivers, operating systems or firmware
            * installing or removing applications, operating systems, network devices or other ICT equipment
            * implementing system changes or enhancements
            * resolving problems identified by users.

            Furthermore, in support of change management processes and procedures, system administrators should document requirements for administrative activities, consider potential security impacts, obtain any necessary approvals, notify users of any disruptions or outages, and maintain system and security documentation.

            One of the greatest threats to the security of networks is the compromise of privileged accounts. Providing a separate privileged operating environment for system administrators, in addition to their unprivileged operating environment, makes it much harder for administrative activities and privileged accounts to be compromised by an adversary.

            Using different physical workstations is the most secure approach to separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments for system administrators. However, a virtualisation-based solution may be sufficient for separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments. In such cases, privileged operating environments should not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments.

In doing so, the use of a jump server (also known as a jump host or jump box) can be an effective way of simplifying and securing administrative activities. Specifically, a jump server can provide filtering of network management traffic while also acting as a focal point to perform multi-factor authentication; store and manage administrative tools; and perform logging, monitoring and alerting activities. Finally, using separate jump servers for the administration of critical servers, high-value servers and regular servers can further assist in protecting these assets."

          prose: |-
            When patches or updates are released by vendors for security vulnerabilities, an organisation should apply them in a timeframe commensurate with the likelihood of attempted exploitation by an adversary. For example, by prioritising patches or updates for security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services and their operating systems, especially when exploitation code exists or active exploitation is occurring.

            If no patches or updates are available for security vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to security vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.

            If a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, the ACSC will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, the ACSC will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied.

In planning for such activities, it is important to note that while vendors generally advise the cessation date for support of operating systems well in advance, some applications, network devices and other ICT equipment may cease to receive support immediately after newer versions are released."

            Implementing a vulnerability disclosure program, based on responsible disclosure, can assist an organisation to improve the security of their products and services as it provides a way for security researchers and other members of the public to responsibly notify them of security vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, following the verification and resolution of reported security vulnerabilities, it can assist an organisation in notifying their customers of security vulnerabilities that have been discovered in their products and services, and any patches, updates or vendor mitigations that should be applied.

            A vulnerability disclosure program should include processes and procedures for receiving, verifying, resolving and reporting security vulnerabilities disclosed by both internal and external parties. In support of this, a vulnerability disclosure policy should be made publicly available that covers:

            * the purpose of the vulnerability disclosure program
            * types of security research that are and are not allowed
            * how to report any security vulnerabilities
            * actions, and associated timeframes, upon notification of security vulnerabilities
            * expectations regarding the public disclosure of security vulnerabilities
            * any recognition or reward for finders of security vulnerabilities.

            Finally, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) encourages security researchers and other members of the public to responsibility report security vulnerabilities directly to an organisation. However, the ACSC recognises that this is not always practical, initial attempts at communication may be unsuccessful or the person making the report may not wish to do so directly. In such cases, security vulnerabilities can be reported to the ACSC as an independent coordinator.

The most common example of output encoding is the conversion of potentially dangerous HTML characters into their encoded equivalents, such as ‘\\<’, ‘\\>’ and ‘\\&’ into ‘\\<’, ‘\\>’ and ‘\\&’."

            DBMS software often comes pre-configured with default database administrator accounts and credentials that are listed in vendor documentation. These default database administrator accounts should be disabled, renamed or have their credentials changed.

            When sharing database administrator accounts for the performance of administrative activities, any actions undertaken will not be attributable to an individual database administrator. This can hinder investigations relating to an attempted or successful intrusion. Furthermore, database administrator accounts shared across different databases can exacerbate any compromise of a database administrator account by an adversary.

            When creating new database administrator accounts, accounts are often allocated all privileges available to system administrators. However, most database administrators will only require a subset of all available privileges to undertake their duties.

            Database administrators and database users should know the sensitivity or classification associated with databases and their contents. In cases where all of a database’s contents are the same sensitivity or classification, an organisation should classify the entire database at this level and protect it as such. Alternatively, in cases where a database’s contents are of varying sensitivities or classifications, and database users have varying levels of access to the database’s contents, an organisation should protect the database’s contents at a more granular level.

            Restricting database users’ ability to access, insert, modify or remove database contents, based on their work duties, ensures that the likelihood of unauthorised access, modification or deletion of database contents is reduced. Furthermore, where concerns exist that the aggregation of separate pieces of content from within a database could lead to an adversary determining more sensitive or classified content, the need-to-know principle can be enforced through the use of minimum privileges, database views and database roles. Alternatively, the content of concern could be separated by implementing multiple databases, each with restricted data sets.

            Requiring user involvement in the protective marking of emails ensures a conscious decision is made by users, thereby lessening the chance of incorrect protective markings being applied to emails. In addition, allowing users to select only protective markings for which a system is authorised to process, store or communicate lessens the chance of users inadvertently over-classifying emails.

            Email content filters may only check the most recent protective marking applied to emails. Therefore, when users are responding to or forwarding emails, requiring protective markings which are at least as high as that of emails that are received will help email content filters prevent emails being sent to systems that are not authorised to handle their original sensitivity or classification.

            It is important that email servers are configured to block emails with inappropriate protective markings. For example, blocking inbound and outbound emails with protective markings higher than the sensitivity or classification of the receiving system, as this will prevent a data spill from occurring. In doing so, it is important to inform the intended recipients of blocked inbound emails, and the senders of blocked outbound emails, that this has occurred.

            If emails are received with invalid or missing protective markings they may still be passed to their intended recipients. However, the recipients will have an obligation to determine appropriate protective markings if emails are to be responded to, forwarded or printed. If unsure, original senders of emails should be contacted to provide guidance on appropriate protective markings.

            Emails can be intercepted anywhere between originating email servers and destination email servers. Implementing opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption can mitigate this security risk while ensuring email servers remain compatible with each other. However, opportunistic TLS encryption is susceptible to downgrade attacks. To mitigate this security risk, Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) allows domain owners to indicate that email transfers should only occur if satisfactory TLS encryption is negotiated beforehand.

            Implementing MTA-STS reduces the opportunity for downgrade attacks during email transfers, and provides visibility of when they are attempted. TLS reporting supports the implementation of MTA-STS by providing a mechanism for a domain owner to publish a location where reports can be submitted regarding the success or failure of attempts to initiate encrypted connections when sending emails to a specified domain.

            DMARC enables a domain owner to specify what action receiving email servers should take as a result of domain alignment, SPF and DKIM checks. For emails that do not pass DMARC checks, this includes ‘reject’ (emails are rejected), ‘quarantine’ (emails are marked as spam) or ‘none’ (no action is taken).

            DMARC also provides a reporting feature which enables a domain owner to receive reports on the actions taken by receiving email servers. While this feature does not mitigate malicious emails sent to the domain owner’s organisation, it can give the domain owner some visibility of attempts by an adversary to spoof their organisation’s domains.

            Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) can be used to implement network segmentation and segregation as long as networks belong to the same security domain. In such cases, if a data spill occurs the impact will be less than if a data spill occurred between two networks of different classifications or between an organisation’s network and public network infrastructure. Should an organisation choose to risk manage implementing VLANs between networks belonging to different security domains, such as at the same classification, additional controls for network devices will apply, such as not sharing VLAN trunks and terminating VLANs on separate physical network interfaces.

            For the purposes of this topic, Multiprotocol Label Switching is considered to be equivalent to VLANs and is subject to the same controls.

            The use of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) can introduce additional security risks to networks. As such, an organisation exclusively using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) should disable IPv6. This will assist in minimising the attack surface of networks and ensure that IPv6 cannot be exploited by an adversary.

            To aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, numerous tunnelling protocols have been developed to allow interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6. Disabling IPv6 tunnelling protocols on networks that do not require such functionality will prevent an adversary from bypassing traditional network defences by encapsulating IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets.

            Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is a method of stateless Internet Protocol (IP) address configuration in IPv6 networks. Notably, it reduces the ability of an organisation to maintain effective logs of IP address assignments on networks. For this reason, stateless IP addressing should be avoided.

DNS event logs captured by a protective DNS service can also be useful for investigating any exploitation attempt or successful compromise of a network by an adversary.

            In selecting a protective DNS service, many commercial offerings exist. In addition, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) also offers a free protective DNS service for all levels of government.

            Some wireless access points come with default Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) or weak default configuration settings. As default SSIDs are often documented on the internet, along with default accounts and credentials, it is important to change default SSIDs of wireless access points along with default credentials and weak configuration settings.

            When changing default SSIDs, it is important that new SSIDs do not bring undue attention to an organisation’s wireless networks. In doing so, SSIDs of wireless networks should not be readily associated with an organisation, the location of their premises or the functionality of wireless networks.

            A method commonly recommended to lower the profile of wireless networks is disabling SSID broadcasting. While this ensures that the existence of wireless networks are not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, SSIDs are still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests. As such, it is easy to determine SSIDs of wireless networks by capturing these requests and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting, an organisation will make it more difficult for users to connect to wireless networks. Furthermore, an adversary could configure a malicious wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as a hidden SSID used by a legitimate wireless network, thereby fooling users or devices into automatically connecting to the adversary’s malicious wireless access point instead. In doing so, the adversary could steal authentication credentials in order to gain access to the legitimate wireless network.

            As wireless networks are often capable of being accessed from outside the perimeter of secured spaces, all wireless network traffic requires suitable cryptographic protection. For this purpose it is recommended that Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) be used as it provides equivalent or greater security than its predecessor Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2). WPA3 has also prohibited the use of various outdated and insecure cipher suites.

            WPA3-Enterprise supports three enterprise modes of operation: enterprise only mode, transition mode and 192-bit mode. Preference is given to WPA3-Enterprise 192-bit mode as this mode incorporates changes that satisfy the United States’ Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite requirements and ensures no algorithms with known weaknesses are used. However, if any other WPA3-Enterprise modes are used then Authentication and Key Management suite 00-0F-AC:1 should be disabled (if this option is available).

It uses a Public Key Infrastructure to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an organisation to have established a Public Key Infrastructure. This involves deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses their wireless networks. While this introduces additional costs and management overheads, the security advantages are significant.

            When issuing certificates to devices in order to access wireless networks, an organisation should be aware that certificates could be stolen by malicious code. Once compromised, certificates could be used on other devices to gain unauthorised access to wireless networks. An organisation should also be aware that in only issuing certificates to devices, any actions taken by users will only be attributable to specific devices.

            When issuing certificates to users in order to access wireless networks, it can be in the form of certificates that are stored on devices or certificates that are stored on smart cards. While issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, it comes at a higher cost. However, users are more likely to notice missing smart cards and alert their security team, who are then able to revoke their credentials, which can minimise the time an adversary has access to wireless networks. In addition, to reduce the likelihood of stolen smart cards from being used to gain unauthorised access to wireless networks, multi-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of personal identification numbers on smart cards. This is particularly important when smart cards grant users any form of administrative access.

When devices roam away from wireless access points they have authenticated to, they will not need to perform a full re-authentication should they roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate devices to neighbouring wireless access points that devices might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for devices each time they roam between wireless access points is ideal, an organisation can choose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming. If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours)."

            Instead of deploying a small number of wireless access points that broadcast on high power, a greater number of wireless access points that use less broadcast power can be deployed to achieve the desired footprint for wireless networks. This has the benefit of providing service continuity should wireless access points become unserviceable. In such cases, the output power of nearby wireless access points can be increased to cover the footprint gap until the unserviceable wireless access points can be replaced.

            In addition to minimising the output power of wireless access points to reduce the footprint of wireless networks, the use of Radio Frequency (RF) shielding can be used for an organisation’s facilities. While expensive, this will limit wireless communications to areas under the control of an organisation. RF shielding on an organisation’s facilities also has the added benefit of preventing the jamming of wireless networks from outside of the facilities in which wireless networks are operating.

An organisation can achieve the same results using their own infrastructure. However, doing so may require significant upfront costs and may still result in a limited capability to scale dynamically to meet increased demand. In case of a denial-of-service attack, cloud-based hosting can also provide segregation from self-hosted or other cloud-hosted services ensuring that other systems, such as email, are not affected."

            It is important that connectivity between an organisation and their cloud service providers meets requirements for bandwidth, latency and reliability. In support of this, an organisation and their cloud service providers should discuss any specific network requirements, performance characteristics or planned responses to availability failures, especially when a requirement for high availability exists. Furthermore, an organisation and their cloud service providers should discuss whether dedicated communication links or connections over the internet will be used and whether any secondary communications links will provide sufficient capacity to maintain operational requirements should the primary communication link become unavailable.

            Furthermore, capacity monitoring should be performed in order to manage workloads and monitor the health of online services. This can be achieved through continuous real-time monitoring of metrics, such as latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput and availability. In addition, feedback should be provided to cloud service providers when performance does not meet service level agreement targets. To assist with this, anomaly detection can be performed through network telemetry that is integrated into security monitoring tools.

            Similar to cloud-based hosting, the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) can allow an organisation to create highly resilient online services by leveraging the large bandwidth, geographically dispersed hosting locations, traffic scrubbing and other controls offered by CDNs.

            The use of CDNs is particularly effective when serving static bandwidth intensive media, such as images, sound or video files. However, the services offered by CDNs can include more than basic content hosting, such as web response caching, load balancing, web application security and denial of service mitigations.

            Care should be taken when configuring the use of CDNs to ensure that the IP addresses of an organisation’s web servers are not identifiable by an adversary, as this could allow for protections to be bypassed. Additionally, appropriate controls should be applied to only allow communication between an organisation’s web servers, CDNs and authorised management networks.

            Denial-of-service attacks are designed to disrupt or degrade online services, such as website, email and Domain Name System services. To achieve this goal, an adversary may use a number of methods to deny access to legitimate users of online services. This includes using multiple computers to direct a large volume of unwanted network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume all available network bandwidth, using multiple computers to direct tailored network traffic at online services in an attempt to consume the processing resources of online services, or hijacking online services in an attempt to redirect legitimate users away from those services to other services that the adversary controls.

            Although an organisation cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks, there are a number of measures they can implement to prepare for and potentially reduce the impact if targeted. This includes engaging with their cloud service providers to identify the denial of service detection technologies that may be available for their use. For example, real-time capacity reporting dashboards that provide out-of-band and real-time alerts based on organisation-defined thresholds can assist with the rapid identification of denial-of-service attacks.

            Finally, not all online services offered by an organisation may be business critical. Understanding what online services can be disabled or offered with reduced functionality during denial-of-service attacks can help an organisation reduce or eliminate the impact on essential services. Overall, preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur is by far the best strategy as it is very difficult to respond once they begin and efforts at this stage are unlikely to be effective.

          # Purpose of cryptography

          The purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of data. In doing so, confidentiality protects data by making it unreadable to all but authorised entities, integrity protects data from accidental or deliberate manipulation by entities, authentication ensures that an entity is who they claim to be, and non-repudiation provides proof that an entity performed a particular action.

          # Using encryption

          Encryption of data at rest can be used to protect sensitive or classified data stored on ICT equipment and media. In addition, encryption of data in transit can be used to protect sensitive or classified data communicated over public network infrastructure. However, when an organisation uses encryption for data at rest, or data in transit, they are not reducing the sensitivity or classification of the data, they are simply reducing the immediate consequences of the data being accessed by an adversary.

          # International standards for cryptographic modules

          International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 19790:2012,
          [Information technology – Security techniques – Security requirements for cryptographic modules](#a07c439d-b2f4-4ee2-b56e-f17000f3722f), and ISO/IEC 24759:2017,
          [Information technology – Security techniques – Test requirements for cryptographic modules](#aaf83df2-02e3-4f9f-bdf5-33fbff42842d), are international standards for the design and validation of hardware and software cryptographic modules.

          # High assurance cryptographic algorithms

          High assurance cryptographic algorithms, which are not covered in this section, can be used for the protection of SECRET and TOP SECRET data if they are suitably implemented in ASD-approved HACE. Further information on high assurance cryptographic algorithms can be obtained from the ACSC.

          # ASD-Approved Cryptographic Algorithms

          There is no guarantee of an algorithm’s resistance to currently unknown attacks. However, the algorithms listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting. Approval for the use of the algorithms listed in this section is limited to cases where they are implemented in accordance with these guidelines.

          The approved asymmetric/public key algorithms are:

          * Diffie-Hellman (DH) for agreeing on encryption session keys
          * Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for digital signatures
          * Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange
          * Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for digital signatures
          * Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) for digital signatures and passing encryption session keys or similar keys.

          The only approved hashing algorithm is Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2).

          The only approved symmetric encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

          Where there is a range of key sizes for an algorithm, some of the smaller key sizes are not approved as they do not provide an adequate safety margin against possible future attacks. For example, advances in integer factorisation methods could render smaller RSA moduli vulnerable.

          The targets used for the effective security strength of algorithms listed within this section are 112 bits for PROTECTED and below data, 128 bits for SECRET data and 192 bits for TOP SECRET data. However, some key sizes and curves are preferred in order to ensure interoperability with the United States’ Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite.

          prose: "The use of Electronic Codebook Mode with block ciphers allows repeated patterns in plaintext to appear as repeated patterns in ciphertext. Most plaintext, including written language and formatted files, contains significant repeated patterns. As such, an adversary can use this to deduce possible meanings of ciphertext. The use of other modes, such as Cipher Block Chaining, Cipher Feedback, Galois/Counter Mode or Output Feedback, can prevent such attacks, although each has different properties which can make them inappropriate for certain use cases. AES is the only approved symmetric encryption algorithm."

          # High assurance cryptographic protocols

          High assurance cryptographic protocols, which are not covered in this section, can be used for the protection of SECRET and TOP SECRET data if they are suitably implemented in ASD-approved HACE. Further information on high assurance cryptographic protocols can be obtained from the ACSC.

          # ASD-Approved Cryptographic Protocols

          There is no guarantee of a protocol’s resistance to currently unknown attacks. However, the protocols listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting. Approval for the use of the protocols listed in this section is limited to cases where they are implemented in accordance with these guidelines.

          The AACPs are:

          * Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          * Secure Shell (SSH)
          * Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME)
          * OpenPGP Message Format
          * Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
          * Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
          * Wi-Fi Protected Access 3.

          # Further information

          Further information on AACPs can be found in the following sections of these guidelines.

          Further information on the use of Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 can be found in the wireless networks section of the

            SSH version 1 was found to have a number of security vulnerabilities, and was subsequently replaced by SSH version 2. As such, an organisation implementing SSH should disable the use of SSH version 1. In addition, a number of security risks exist when SSH is configured in an insecure manner. To mitigate these security risks, SSH should be configured as per the configuration settings below.

            The configuration settings below are based on OpenSSH. An organisation using other implementations of SSH should adapt these settings to suit their SSH implementation.

            If using logins without a passphrase for automated purposes, a number of security risks may arise, specifically:

            * if access from unknown Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is not restricted, an adversary could automatically authenticate to systems without needing to know any passphrases
            * if port forwarding is not disabled, or it is not configured securely, access may be gained to forwarded ports, thereby, creating a communication channel between an adversary and a host
            * if agent credential forwarding is enabled, an adversary could connect to the stored authentication credentials and use them to connect to other trusted hosts, or even intranet hosts if port forwarding has been allowed as well
            * if X11 display remoting is not disabled, an adversary could gain control of displays as well as keyboard and mouse control functions
            * if console access is allowed, every user who logs into the console could run programs that are normally restricted to authenticated users.

            To assist in mitigating these security risks, it is essential that the ‘forced command’ option is used to specify what command is executed and parameter checking is enabled.

            IPsec contains two major protocols, the Authentication Header (AH) protocol and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol. In order to provide a secure Virtual Private Network style connection, both authentication and encryption are needed. While the AH and ESP protocols can both provide authentication, for the IP packet and the payload respectively, only the ESP protocol can provide encryption.

            As the combined use of the AH protocol and the ESP protocol is not supported by Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2, the ESP protocol should be used for authentication and encryption of IPsec connections.

          # Introduction to gateways

          Gateways securely manage data flows between connected networks from different security domains. In doing so, gateways take on the highest sensitivity or classification of connected security domains.

          This section describes controls applicable to all types of gateways. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of gateways being deployed and the security domains involved. For example, the Cross Domain Solutions section should be consulted for gateways between different security domains where at least one security domain is classified SECRET or TOP SECRET.

          Personnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of gateways should also refer to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)’s
          [gateway security guidance package](#3df21b72-0559-4bbf-a990-5ee509f70747) of publications.

            Gateways are critical for an organisation to reduce the security risks associated with providing external parties with access to their networks. In doing so, it is important that gateways are used not only between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, but also between an organisation’s networks that belong to different security domains and between an organisation’s networks and other organisations’ networks that are connected via means other than public network infrastructure.

            When implementing gateways between an organisation’s networks and public network infrastructure, an organisation should place any services that external parties require access to within a demilitarised zone. This can mitigate security risks for an organisation when hosting such services in an internet-accessible manner.

            Finally, in architecting gateways, it is important that they only allow explicitly authorised data flows. In support of this, gateways should inspect and filter data flows at the transport and above network layers. Furthermore, gateways should be capable of performing ingress traffic filtering to detect and prevent Internet Protocol (IP) source address spoofing.

            In identifying suitable system administrators for gateways, it is important that individuals comply with any citizenship requirements, undergo appropriate employment screening and, where necessary, hold an appropriate security clearance based on the sensitivity or classification of gateways. For example, all systems administrators for gateways between OFFICIAL and PROTECTED networks will need to hold baseline security clearances.

            In addition, when creating privileged accounts for performing administrative activities, it is important that the principle of least privilege is followed. In turn, this should be supported by the principle of separation of duties. Adhering to these two principles can ensure that system administrators for gateways are not given enough privileges to abuse gateways on their own.

            Finally, providing system administrators for gateways with formal training on the operation and management of gateways will ensure that they are fully aware of, and accept, their roles and responsibilities. In doing so, formal training should be conducted through tailored privileged user training.

          # Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions

          A Cross Domain Solution (CDS) is a system comprised of security-enforcing functions tailored to mitigate specific security risks associated with accessing or transferring data between different security domains. CDSs may be an integrated appliance or, more commonly, be composed of discrete technologies or sub-systems, with each sub-system consisting of hardware or software components.

          This section describes the controls applicable to CDSs and extends upon the prior gateways section. Additional sections of these guidelines should also be consulted depending on the types of CDSs being deployed.

          Personnel involved in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of CDSs should also refer to the ACSC’s
          [Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions](#86847be4-3a06-4d2f-9952-447158593e0d) and
          [Fundamentals of Cross Domain Solutions](#f32020e9-4cb3-486b-bcbb-6fb6719f58a5) publications.

          # Types of Cross Domain Solutions

          This section defines two types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs and Access CDSs. These definitions are closely aligned with how CDSs are described and sold by vendors. Note, however, vendors may also offer combined Access and Transfer CDSs.

          In defining the functionality of different types of CDSs, Transfer CDSs facilitate the transfer of data in one direction (unidirectional) or multiple directions (bi-directional) between different security domains. In comparison, Access CDSs provide users with access to multiple security domains from a single device. However, while Access CDSs allow interaction with different security domains, they do not allow users to move data between the different security domains.

            Defining an organisation-approved list of domain names, and blocking all others, removes one of the most common data exfiltration paths used by an adversary. In doing so, even a relatively permissive list of allowed domain names, such as the entire Australian top-level domain (‘\*.au’) or the top 1,000 websites from the Alexa website ranking, offers better security than relying solely on a list of malicious domain names.

            Furthermore, in cases where an organisation chooses to implement a relatively permissive list of allowed domain names, or list of website categories, security risks can be further mitigated by blocking dynamic domain names, or domain names that can be registered anonymously for free, as these are often used by an adversary due to their lack of attribution. Finally, as users rarely have a requirement to access websites via their IP addresses instead of their domain names, the presence of such activities could indicate malicious code attempting to communicate with an adversary’s command and control infrastructure and should be blocked.

          # Content filtering techniques

          The following content filtering techniques should be considered as part of an organisation’s content filtering implementation for gateways and CDSs:

          * Antivirus scans: Scans files for viruses and other malicious code.
          * Automated dynamic analysis: Analyses executable files run in a sandbox to detect suspicious behaviour.
          * File extension checks: Checks file extensions to determine purported file types.
          * File format checks: Checks files conform to defined file format specifications.
          * File type checks: Checks file headers to determine actual file types.
          * Keyword checks: Checks files for keywords that could indicate undesirable content.
          * Metadata checks: Checks files for metadata that should be removed.
          * Protective marking checks: Checks files for protective markings that may indicate undesirable content.
          * Manual inspections: Involves the manual inspection of files for suspicious or undesirable content that an automated system may miss, which is particularly important for multimedia and content rich files.

            As encryption can be used to bypass content filtering checks, this poses a security risk in that malicious code could enter networks, or data could be exfiltrated from networks, undetected. In addition, encrypted files could mask data at a higher classification than that authorised to pass through gateways or CDSs, which could result in a data spill. As such, encrypted files should be decrypted in order to undergo content filtering checks.

            Note, where a requirement to preserve the confidentiality of encrypted files exists, an organisation may consider a dedicated system to allow encrypted files to be decrypted in an appropriately secure environment before being subjected to all applicable content filtering checks.

            Archive files can be used to bypass content filtering checks if content filters do not handle such files correctly. Ensuring content filters recognise archive files will ensure the embedded files they contain are subject to the same content filtering checks as un-archived files.

            Archive files can be constructed in a manner which can result in a denial of service to content filters due to processor, memory or disk space exhaustion. To limit the likelihood of such situations, content filters can specify resource constraints while unpacking archive files. If these constraints are exceeded, content filtering checks should be terminated.

This applies to all forms of data transfers, such as those performed using removable media, gateways or CDSs. Ideally, data transfer logs should contain information on who authorised the data transfer, what data was transferred, where the data was transferred from or to, when the data was transferred, why the data was transferred, and how the data was transferred. Monitoring of such activities, via periodic verification of data transfer logs, can assist in identifying abuse of data transfer privileges and any unusual usage patterns that may indicate attempts by an adversary to surreptitiously import malicious code or exfiltrate data from SECRET and TOP SECRET systems."
