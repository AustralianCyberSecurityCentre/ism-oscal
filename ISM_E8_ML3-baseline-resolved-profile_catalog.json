This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.\n\n# Detecting cyber security incidents\n\nOne of the core elements of detecting and investigating cyber security incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources, such as event logs. The following event logs can be used by an organisation to assist with detecting and investigating cyber security incidents:\n\n- **Cross Domain Solutions:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Databases:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Domain Name System services:** May assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domain names or Internet Protocol addresses indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Email servers:** May assist in identifying users targeted with phishing emails thereby helping to identify the initial vector of a compromise.\n- **Gateways:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Multifunction devices: May assist in**identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating a cyber security incident or malicious insider activity.\n- **Operating systems:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Remote access services:** May assist in identifying unusual locations of access or times of access indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Security services:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Server applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **System access:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **User applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Web applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n- **Web proxies:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.\n\n# Further information\n\nFurther information on event logging can be found in the event logging and monitoring section of the [Guidelines for System Monitoring](#edc24216-f52b-4513-bcda-5fa564661999).\n\nFurther information on cyber security incident response plans can be found in the system-specific security documentation section of the [Guidelines for Security Documentation](#578d0434-6b3f-46f3-aad8-c7ac75c2ebcc).\n\nFurther information on establishing and operating a trusted insider program can be found in the Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute’s [Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats, Sixth Edition](#cad720b4-e47a-437d-b272-6958e738131d) publication.\n\nFurther information on reporting of cyber security incidents by service providers can be found in the managed services and cloud services section of the [Guidelines for Procurement and Outsourcing](#f37a4848-0791-4870-b316-5536c2681c28).\n\nFurther information on [reporting cybercrime incidents](#188466f6-be12-49ce-b99a-981e54b1663e) and [reporting cyber security incidents](#626d3582-3caf-49d6-89d5-4b8fdbbf1f31) is available from ASD."

When developing application control rulesets, determining approved executables (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm files), HTML applications (e.g. .hta files), control panel applets (e.g. .cpl files) and drivers based on business requirements is a more secure method than simply approving those already residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable that an organisation defines their own application control rulesets, rather than relying on those from application control vendors, and validate them on an annual or more frequent basis.\n\nIn implementing application control, an organisation should use a reliable method, or combination of methods, such as cryptographic hash rules, publisher certificate rules or path rules. Depending on the method chosen, further hardening may be required to ensure that application control mechanisms and application control rulesets cannot be bypassed by malicious actors.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing application control events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents."

This can be especially risky for office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products as such applications are routinely targeted for exploitation. Many settings exist within such applications to allow them to be configured in an approved secure state in order to minimise this security risk. As such, ASD and vendors often produce hardening guidance to assist in hardening the configuration of these applications. Note, however, in situations where ASD and vendor hardening guidance conflicts, precedence should be given to implementing the most restrictive guidance."

A macro can contain a series of commands that can be coded or recorded and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve their productivity. However, malicious actors can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to exfiltrate or deny access to data. To reduce this security risk, an organisation should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that do.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing Microsoft Office macro events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents."

This may include:\n\n- something users know, such as a memorised secret (i.e. personal identification number, password or passphrase)\n- something users have, such as a security key, smart card, passkey, smartphone or one-time password token\n- something users are, such as a fingerprint pattern or their facial geometry.\n\nUsers of online services, privileged users of systems and users with access to data repositories are more likely to be targeted by malicious actors due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing malicious actors’ ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.\n\nWhen implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something users have should be used with something users know. Alternatively, something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (often known as passwordless multi-factor authentication) can be used. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication is recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.\n\nFinally, centrally logging and analysing multi-factor authentication events can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents."

As such, it is critical that credentials for break glass accounts, local administrator accounts and service accounts are long, unique, unpredictable and managed.\n\nTo provide additional security and credential management functionality for service accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts to Microsoft Windows Server. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service Accounts do not require manual credential management by system administrators, as the operating system automatically ensures that they are long, unique, unpredictable and managed. This ensures that service account credentials are secure, not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular basis. However, in cases where the use of group Managed Service Accounts is not possible, credentials for service accounts should still be unique and unpredictable with a minimum length of 30 characters."

For example, when smart cards are left on desks, one-time password tokens are left in laptop computer bags, security keys are left connected to computers or passphrases are written down and stuck to computer monitors. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.\n\nWhen using Microsoft Windows systems, memory integrity, Local Security Authority protection, Credential Guard and Remote Credential Guard functionality, all preferably with a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) lock, can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials. In addition, malicious actors that have access to systems may attempt to steal cached credentials. To reduce this security risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.\n\nIf storing credentials on systems, sufficient protection should be implemented to prevent them from being compromised. For example, credentials can be stored in a password manager or hardware security module, while credentials stored in a database should be hashed, salted and stretched. Coupled with this, an organisation should regularly scan their systems to detect and remediate any credentials that are being stored in an unprotected manner, such as in the clear in documents, on network file shares or in other data repositories."

Providing a separate privileged operating environment for system administrators, in addition to their unprivileged operating environment, makes it much harder for administrative activities and privileged accounts to be compromised by malicious actors.\n\nUsing different physical workstations, with one being a dedicated Secure Admin Workstation, is the most secure approach to separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments for system administrators. However, a trusted and hardened virtualisation-based solution may be sufficient for separating privileged and unprivileged operating environments on the same Secure Admin Workstation. In such cases, privileged operating environments should not be virtualised within unprivileged operating environments."

This is especially important when vulnerabilities are assessed as critical by vendors or working exploits exist.\n\nIf no patches or updates are available for vulnerabilities, mitigation advice from vendors, trusted authorities or security researchers may provide some protection until patches or updates are made available. Such mitigation advice may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, announcements made relating to vulnerabilities. Mitigation advice may cover how to disable or block access to vulnerable functionality, how to reconfigure vulnerable functionality, or how to detect attempted or successful exploitation of vulnerable functionality.\n\nIf a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, ASD will conduct an assessment of the patch or update. Subsequently, if the patch or update is approved for deployment, ASD will provide guidance on the methods and timeframes in which it is to be applied."
